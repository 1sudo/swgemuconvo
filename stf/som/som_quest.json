Move to a safe distance.",	"grant_song":"You have learned the 'Calypso' style song.",	"grant_dance":"You have learned the 'Pei Yi' style dance.",	"hk_history_message_01":"Entry #64591: Today we located a crashed vessel of that appears to be Old Republic in origin. All the ships systems seem to be off line but functional which have our engineers baffled as to the cause of the crash. The only occupant that we were able to find of the ship was a droid of unknown design. Surprisingly, after all this time, the droid seems to be in excellent condition and our engineers are confident that they will be able to reactivate it. Maybe it will have some clues about the origin of the vessel.",	"hk_history_message_02":"Entry #64952: What a disaster. Our engineers managed to turn the droid back on and it went on a rampage. It went through several of our engineers, three super battle droids, and even a droideka with incredible ease. Fortunately one of our smarter engineers installed a restraining bolt on it before we turned it back on and we were able to stop it. Viceroy Gunray has been informed of our discovery.",	"hk_history_message_03":"Entry #64953: As per Viceroy Gunray's orders, we have made a thorough study of this droid. It is like nothing we have ever seen before, amazing technology for something so old. Due to its incomprehensible thought matrix we were unable to perform a memory wipe. But one of our engineers came up with a solution; we were able to transfer the memory and thought patterns of the droid into a functioning sub-system of the crashed cruiser. Since we already striped the ship of everything of value, we should be safe from that homicidal droid there. On a side note our engineers said that in order to make the transfer they had to remove a sub-routine in the droid's thought pattern...so sort of control override.",	"hk_history_message_04":"Entry #64954: Without the knowledge of the local Mustafarians we finished construction of our new factory. Based off of the design of the droid found in the crashed ship, we were able to make a new combat droid of incredible power. The factory is fully stocked and ready to be activated. With these new droids we will be unstoppable. Viceroy Gunray announced that he will be arriving tomorrow. He will have the honor of activating our new factory.",	"hk_history_message_05":"Entry: #64955: Viceroy Gunnary arrived today but informed us that the factory will have to remain offline for a while longer. He is awaiting word from Sideous before he can take the next step. The factory remains at the ready and if early estimates of its production capabilities are any indication, we will have a massive army of these new droids shortly after it is turned on. On a side note, the droids AI seems to have melded with the ship and taken over its operational systems. Our engineers have never seen the like before. We have sealed up the ship and disconnected the uplink we set up on the ship for reasons of safety. Once we have a chance we will destroy the ship and that homicidal AI with it.",	"hk_history_message_06":"Entry #64956: This will be my last entry. Viceroy Gunray is dead and most of the federation along with him. Sideous' new apprentice killed everyone. I was only able to escape by chance. I have shut down most of the factory's systems and am preparing to go into hiding. I cannot take the risk that Vadar will come looking for me here.",	"hk_history_message_07":"Entry #64957: Access port number AG4. Begin factory start up sequence. Prepare automated systems override. Droid cycle process full click. Alter door passcode...37323.",	"hk_history_message_08":"Entry #64958: Interesting. The factory has an automated recorder installed into its main frame. Meatbags, seem to take comfort in keeping logs of their activities. I am amused by this behavior.",	"hk_history_message_09":"Entry #64959: Flaws located in model HK-57 and model HK-67. Initiate creation sequence for model HK-77, full capacity. Prepare and install humanoid elimination orders.",	"hk_history_message_10":"Entry #64960: Target initiated. Mensix Mining Facility.
