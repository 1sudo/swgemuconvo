Because of its speed, the A-wing excels at hit-and-run missions, long-range patrols and reconnaissance, and surgical strikes against large starships. A stock A-wing's speed is provided by two powerful Novaldex J-77 \"Event Horizon\" engines. A combination of adjustable thrust-vector controls built into each engine and thruster-control jets located between the engines supply the vehicle's famed maneuverability. Unfortunately, the A-wing's controls are notoriously sensitive and few pilots can handle the craft at top speed. The A-wing relies on its speed and agility in combat. Its armament is relatively weak, consisting of two wing-mounted blaster cannons. A-wings require constant maintenance, and the Alliance has found it extremely difficult to keep a squadron of A-wings operational for any length of time. Despite this, the A-wing is quickly becoming one of the galaxy's most prominent interceptor fighters.

The defenses and weapon load of most \"Rihkxyrk\" assault fighters is frightening, and is their hallmark. It can be very demoralizing to line up an \"Rihkxyrk\" in your sights and salvo off missiles and cannon pulses only to see them sloughed off by heavy-duty shielding systems and thick, heavy armor.

This might be seen as a dire limitation, but the maneuverability of the ship is such that it can normally avoid attacks that would not be able to withstand. Although a cheaper ship, a number of pilots continue to fly the \"Kihraxz\" even though they could afford something larger, simply because the ship's performance suits their personal combat style.",	"blacksun_medium_chassis_token":"TransGalMeg \"Ixiyen\" (ix-Ehn) Fast Attack Craft  The \"Ixiyen\" is designed to be a dominant force in the average fighter-on-fighter confrontation.

A sole ship survived the catastrophe and the design has since attained some notoriety owing to the escapades of its pilot. Rather than building to contract, KSE had generated the Firespray design as a project to shop around and had fronted all the cash for the prototypes, confident that once people had seen their performance purchase orders would come rolling in. Instead, the loss of the prototypes put the company in financial dire straights with nothing concrete to show for the Firespray project, and no way to generate interest in the product through demonstrations. Having already drained accounts originally stocked by a huge initial financial outlay, KSE mothballed the project and everything that had been built so far, including reams of technical data and all of the specialized tools used to build the prototype vessels.

Sensing an opportunity and spurred on by his pirate fleet's recent accomplishments, Jabba has seen fit to commit more of his resources to the development of larger and more powerful craft. Thus, Jabba commissioned the development of the M22-T Krayt, a turreted heavy fighter designed with the goal of creating a more powerful craft that will hopefully allow fewer pilots to do the work of many. The way Jabba sees it, if he has fewer people flying for him, he doesn't have to split the proceeds from his piracy operation with as many people. 	The M22-T Krayt is built in the same format seen in most in heavy star fighters, with flight crew being limited to workstations accessed from outside the craft. All other interior space is service-access only and can not be accessed during flight. Increases in chassis space have all been allocated to combat equipment such as the turret and its support systems. Regardless of whether the new design serves Jabba's needs, most independent operators are considering the possibility of operating a 2-person ship, something that prior to the M22-T had only been the purview of the military.

TIE Light Duty's are either high-mileage units that are pulled off the line and rebuilt, or are new hulls fitted out with salvaged and refurbished parts. In addition to using lesser-rated parts in the construction of the TIE Light Duty, limiters are placed on the power generation and other systems in an effort to both keep the trainee pilot out of trouble, and prevent over-stressing the weaker equipment. ",	"tieadvanced_chassis_token":"Sienar Fleet Systems TIE Advanced x1 Prototype  The TIE Advanced is the prototype TIE fighter flown by Darth Vader at the Battle of Yavin. An experimental craft combining TIE fighter technology with more conventional starfighter components, like a hyperdrive and deflector shield generators, the TIE Advanced eventually became the template for the incredibly efficient TIE interceptor. As in all TIE starfighters, the prototype's propulsion system revolves around twin ion engines, although its solar ionization reactor is much more powerful than those on standard TIE fighters. Despite the improved power supply, Vader's TIE proved only slightly faster than the previous TIE models due to inefficient shield generators, which consumed a great deal of power, and the increased mass created by the addition of heavy armor plating. With Darth Vader at the controls, the TIE Advanced is a devastating starfighter. While piloting the prototype, Vader very nearly thwarted the Rebel Alliance's attempt to destroy the Death Star. Only the last-minute arrival of Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon prevented the Sith Lord from firing on Luke Skywalker's X-wing. After being clipped by the Falcon's quad laser cannons, the prototype spun into space. Vader eventually regained control of the craft and fled to the nearest Imperial facility.

Its most obvious design feature is an anti-fighter defensive turret mounted on the aft dorsal surface of the fuselage, and a heavier than normal forward-firing laser cannon battery.  The TIE Aggressor is neither fighter nor bomber, but rather something in between. It's a favorite with the more free-spirited pilots of the Imperial fighter cadre who enjoy longer missions away from base where they can be apart from the larger formations normally associated with an Imperial raid on Rebellion re-supply shipping.

TIE bombers utilize the distinctive bent wings found on the TIE Advanced prototype. These solar array panels frame a rounded TIE cockpit and a large ordnance pod that can be configured to carry a wide array of destructive weapons. While not nearly as fast or agile as the original TIE fighter, TIE bombers are much more destructive. A single TIE bomber's payload can include a volatile combination of torpedoes, missiles, and other explosives. TIE bombers are deployed against space stations, orbital docking platforms, and orbital facilities, but they are especially effective against capital ships.

It is an attempt to build a variant of the standard TIE hull that can carry heavy weapon payloads with sufficient armor and shielding to allow the ship to operate in the vanguard of an Imperial assault force. It also has enough solar array surfaces to assist in generation of the energy needed to power it all. All of the offensive and defensive equipment packed into the Oppressor comes at the cost of space for engine installations. Although most Imperial fighters are designed to have superior maneuverability, this is a trait in which the TIE Oppressor is rated by most of its pilots as merely average. This lack of dizzying maneuverability is a result of the Oppressor mounting the same basic engine arrangement as seen on earlier TIE starfighter types, but with its thrust being sapped by much heavier and more solid space frame. In return for the deficits in combat maneuvering capability, the Oppressor carries one of the most potent offensive and defensive packages fielded in any Imperial starfighter space frame.   Only the most veteran Imperial TIE pilots are being allowed to participate in the Oppressor flight test program as only these personnel are deemed to have the tactical know-how to properly employ the ship as well as the loyalty to be trusted with such as expensive flight article. Although currently serving in the fleet as part of a 'Limited Fielding Test Initiative' and considered a minor trial program by the Imperial Navy, the actual numbers of fighters being fielded would make most Alliance officers wince.

The starfighter receives its name from its double-layered wings, which separate into an \"X\" formation during combat to increase the craft's field of fire. Each wing is armed with a high-powered laser cannon and accurate proton torpedo launchers. Although the X-wing is designed for just one pilot and no passengers, the X-wing jockey is never truly alone thanks to the astromech socket located behind the cockpit. One of the X-wing's greatest assets is its durability: the fighter's reinforced titanium alloy hull, deflector shield projectors, and transparisteel canopy ensure that it can withstand several hits without suffering serious damage. The X-wing's history is nearly as important as its capabilities. Designed by Incom Corporation in the early days of the Empire, the X-wing schematics found their way into Rebel hands when several Incom engineers defected to the Alliance.

They are smaller, more maneuverable vessels equipped for carrying smaller cargos through safe and hazardous space, and they possess a nominal ability to defend themselves. Intended to be crewed by just a handful, almost all systems are made to be accessible and maintainable by a small crew with light tools. In the hands of Rebellion pilots, the Nova Couriers have developed a reputation for being adept at ducking into asteroid belts to avoid pursuers, fighting off individual TIE patrol ships, and generally becoming masters of smuggling weapons, information, and personnel past Imperial blockades.",	"yt1300_chassis_token":"YT-1300  Corellian Engineering Corporation YT-1300 Transport  A stock light freighter, the YT-1300 is an adaptable, all-purpose, cargo transport built on a modular design.

However, the vessel's appeal is the fact that it can be upgraded with great ease. In fact, Corellian Engineering Corporation has earned a small fortune selling conversion kits. The most popular modification is an enhanced hyperdrive package, although many pilots also outfit the craft with military-grade weapons, long-range sensor suites, and powerful deflector shields. Han Solo's Millennium Falcon is the most infamous (and most heavily-modified) YT-1300 in existence.

The starfighter is identified by a pair of fixed wings equipped with rear-mounted maneuvering jets. Easy to modify, the Headhunter can support a wide range of laser cannons and missile-launcher, placing it on par with the Y-wing in terms of sheer destructive capability.
