		"encoded_document":"Data encoded on a disk, compatible with a standard datapad or computer system.",	"transfer_auth":"This is an Imperial Authorization of Transfer form, digitally encoded on a thick reinforced military disk. The form details the official record of your service in the Imperial Navy. It needs to be countersigned before you can be officially accepted for transfer.",	"firespray_schematic_part":"This is a fragment of a Kuat Systems Engineering technical schematic.  Maybe if you had the other pieces, an analysis tool could make sense of its garbled contents.",	"newbie_ship":"This is a spaceship entrusted to you by a pilot trainer.  It is limited in its capabilities---you may not modify it, and the ship is not equipped with a hyperdrive.  You will need to get a crafted chassis before you can modify your ship, or travel at lightspeed.",	"palace_access_doc":"These appear to be forged documents for entry into the palace of Jabba the Hutt. They don't seem to have been used yet, so you only need to glue a photo of yourself onto them and sign the dotted line. Thumb print is apparently accepted for those without reading and writing comprehension.",	"gunship_neutral_pcd_d":"The Black Sun's transports became a common sight in both the underworld and legitimate shipping with the advent of Xizor Transport Systems.  This particular transport class became well known as lightly defended.  Pirates from a variety of bands began picking off the freighters, particularly those smuggling illegal cargo for Black Sun.  Instead of dedicating fighters to escort transports carrying valuable cargo, Black Sun began modifying some of their transports to carry heavy firepower and act as escorts for the rest of the convoys.  Named after Black Sun's lieutenants, the Vigo's, this once-merchant class vessel has been elevated to the status of \"Gunship\".",	"turret_ladder_d":"This is a ladder leading into a turret.",	"gunship_rebel_pcd_d":"The Incom X4 Gunship is a direct response to the Rebel Alliance's lack of capital class starships.  Due to constant low resources within the Alliance, these sturdy vessels are designed with the idea of being cross compatible with components from various starship manufacturers and utilize affordable and basic technologies.  Incom X4's often work best as support vessels and act as mobile headquarters for Rebel commanders.",	"gunship_imperial_pcd_d":"Although this ship might look similar to the Lambda-class shuttle at first glance, don't let appearances deceive you.  The Galactic Empire uses the Imperial YE-4 gunship in situations that call for aggressive firepower."
