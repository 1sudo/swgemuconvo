They could be located anywhere on Dathomir.  Each camp has a shield generator that must be powered down remotely before you can infiltrate the camp.  In order to find the frequency codes for the various shield generators in use at the enemy camps, you must hunt down members of the enemy force and relieve them of any frequence code datadisks they might be carrying.  If you return such a datadisk to Captain Sarguillo, he will give you a remote control configured for the frequency code on the disk.  You may then use this remote to power down the corresponding shield.   Once you have a remote control device (or you are grouped with someone who has one),  you may attempt to capture the camp's commander.   There are two ways to earn credit for this mission:  Option 1:  Power down the shield generator and eliminate at least 5 of the enemy's troops afterwards - that should be enough to lure the commander out.  You will also be made personally responsible for making sure the commander gets back safely to Aurilia.  If you perish any time after the shield comes down but before the commander is captured, i.e. you will need to complete 'Option 2' below, instead of allowing one of your group mates to take on that responsibility.   Option 2:  Join a group with someone who powered down the shield generator and capture the commander.  You must then safely return him to Captain Sarguillo for questioning.   Since the Aurilians value teamwork and comraderie so greatly, you will receive a mission bonus from Captain Sarguillo if you complete this mission with a friend.  To become eligible for the bonus, one of you must power down the shield and one of you must capture the commander.   Remember that the mission is not complete for any participant until the commander is safely returned to the Aurilian village.",	"fs_cs_kill_guards_sum":"Kill 5 Enemy Troops",	"fs_cs_kill_guards_detail":"Kill at least 5 of the camp's defending troops and stay alive until the commander has been captured.",	"fs_cs_primary_escort_detail":"You have taken custody of the base commander.  Being a well-trained agent of the Dark Side, he has ingested a quantity of biotoxins in an attempt to end his own life before being captured and interrogated.  Make haste and return the commander to the village before the toxins take their toll on him.  Without medical attention from the Aurilian healers, he will not live to see the interrogation chambers.  You have less than an hour to return him to the village.  If the commander is not safely returned to the village, no one who has participated in the mission will receive credit.  If you lose custody of the commander, you will lose this mission.",	"fs_cs_primary_escort_sum":"Return the Commander to Aurilia",	"fs_cs_secondary_escort_sum":"Escort the Commander to Aurilia",	"fs_cs_secondary_escort_detail":"The commander has been captured by someone in your group.  You must ensure that he is delivered to Aurilia safe and sound.  Being a well trained agent of the Dark Side, the commander has ingested a quantity of bio toxins in an attempt to end his own life before being captured and interrogated.  If he is not returned to the village for immediate medical attention he will surely perish and your efforts will have been in vain.  If the commander does not make it to the village, you will not receive credit for this mission.
