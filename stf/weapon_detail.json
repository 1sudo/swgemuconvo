A Traditional Jedi weapon, it consists of a cylindrical handle in which sophisticated circuits channel a beam of light through a series of crystals.  These crystals modulate the blade's size and amplitude. When activated, internal power cells create photoelectric energy which is focused through the crystals.  The energy is formed into a tight, parallel beam of coherent packets. These packets are emitted through a positively-charged continuous energy lens which projects the packets away from the lightsaber. The packets are almost immediately attracted back to the lightsaber by a negatively-charged high-energy flux aperture, and then continually recycled to create the glowing blade. The packets are recycled by a superconductor back into the power cell for re-energizing. The entire process is completely contained.
