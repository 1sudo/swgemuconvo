		"hi":"Hey there. How's it going with you?",	"hows_work":"Not too bad. How's work going?",	"same":"The same as always. You know how it is. I walk down one hall, then I walk down another. They never even get dirty. Sometimes I wonder what Milo thinks we need hall monitors for.",	"obi_wan":"Yeah...hey, I saw him again. You know that ghost fella I told you about early. This time I was just standing out on the sail and...BAM...there he was, clear as day. He was just standing across the flow, staring at this place. I wonder what he wants?",	"not_again":"Oh, come on! Once is funny, but I am starting to think you really believe that you are seeing ghosts. I am telling you that if any of the foremen hear you talking like this they will stomp a mud hole in you.",	"no_really":"No, really! I am telling you that I keep seeing that ghost fella. He doesn't seem to be mean or anything...in fact, he gives me sort of peaceful feeling.",	"you_are_crazy":"Have you been hit by the trilom? There is no such thing as ghosts and if they did, they most certainly wouldn't be interested in this place. What is a ghost going to do with a ton of ore...make a house?"
