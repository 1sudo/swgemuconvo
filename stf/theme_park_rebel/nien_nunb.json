		"npc_1_1":"Hello to your person. The Regal One has messaged your expectation of arrival. Problems are had by myself concerning a made to be shifted linguistic decoder that was transacted by a regional purveyor of droids fittings. A request is made for your help. Locate the seller and transport him to my person. Are you understanding?",	"npc_1_2":"Thanks again for the previous help. When I was landing the Falcon in a safer, more secret hiding place, I noticed a small craft landing nearby our location. You weren't expecting anybody were you? Nah... I didn't think you were. Well, I hate to say, but you have someone following you, and you might want to take care of it before they find us.",	"npc_1_3":"Uh-oh. What am I gonna do? If Han finds out about this, he'll... hey! I... uh... need your help. I guess when I was tracking the bounty hunter's ship, I never bothered to complete my own scans of the area. Yeah... um... well, it seems that our basecamp is in proximity to a nearby Pirate camp. Uh... could you help stop the Pirates stealing the Falcon?",	"npc_2_1":"Relief is greatly filling me. The location of the said trafficker is expected to be an inverse of a great distance. Appreciation will be granted upon the finality of your agenda. Hastened movement will increase the feelings of gratitude. Take your fears and dispatch them, for the dealer should comprehend the condition.",	"npc_2_2":"I'm glad to hear that I won't have to scrape you out of a mess. Now, from what I gather, I'm pretty certain the craft has fully landed, and this person is on their way to track you down. If they're friendly, that's fine... but I've seen that type of flying before, and I'll wager 1000 credits that's a bounty hunter. Stop by when the coast is clear.",	"npc_2_3":"Thank you, thank you, thank you! Okay, here's where I landed the Falcon. You should find the pirates somewhere about here... I've highlighted it on your datapad for you. If you scare a number of them off, the rest should leave as well. If they won't listen to reason... well, they're pirates, if you understand what I'm saying.",	"npc_3_1":"The emotion of anger is projected at the malfunctioning device in question. With a viewing of the past, knowledge provides information to the effect that currency should not have parted my appendages for said object. Blessings be unto you regardless of the outcome.",	"npc_3_2":"I'm not too sure about that, friend. By the looks of the ship - and I got a pretty close look without being spotted, I'd say that's a bounty hunter after you. Then again, we are on Lok... I'd still rather be safe than sorry.",	"npc_3_3":"Ooooh.... please! You have to help! If Solo finds out that I parked his baby next to some Pirates, he'll kill me! Seriously! I think he might actually kill me!",	"npc_4_1":"A device created for the intent of the decoding of syllables between both Sullustan and Basic was acquired in exchange for legal tender. The aforementioned splinter of dung has experienced a series of failed functions, resulting in unintended methods of communication. Does the possibility exist of your person performing assistance?",	"npc_4_2":"Well, it's still a bit hush-hush, so I can't say much - that's up to Han. I was asked by Solo to navigate us to a safe spot on the planet, so that's why I'm out here. His Wookiee friend went to accompany him with gathering old contacts. From what I gather, I'm not too sure if I really want to ask too many questions about either of their pasts. ",	"npc_4_3":"You mean the one that goes: there's nothing Han Solo cares more about in this galaxy than the Millennium Falcon? Umm. Yeah. That's why we can't say anything to him about it, okay? He told me if anything happens to the Falcon, he'll tell Chewbacca to get angry. You've heard what they say an angry Wookiee does to your arms, right?",	"npc_reward_1":"Thank you soooo much! I knew I should have been wary of buying a 'prototype' using a protocol droid brain to translate to other languages. Thanks again! Princess Leia told us to expect you. Look, I have to go move the Millennium Falcon to a safer location, so I can't talk right now. Check back with me in a bit, because I might have need of you.",	"npc_reward_2":"Well, from what you say, it sounds like you had a bounty hunter on your tail when you left Corellia and had been stalking you all over Lok. You sure are lucky this guy wasn't a professional, or you wouldn't be here to tell me about it. I'll go see if Han is still busy... hmmm? What's that? Hm. Let me check on this warning beacon, then we'll talk some more.",	"npc_reward_3":"You saved the Falcon?! Oh, thank you so very much. Now, before Han finds out what happened, I'll need to check the damage on this Falcon. If it's damaged, it will be extremely hard to find parts. That's an old YT-1300, not to mention heavily modified at that. If you would, could you please check back with me a little later?",	"player_1_1":"If you mean escort a guy here, sure I'll help.",	"player_1_2":"Yeah, I'll clean up after myself.",	"player_1_3":"They're stealing the Falcon!!? I'll help you!",	"player_2_1":"Sorry, I can't understand anything you're saying. I can't help.",	"player_2_2":"No thanks. I know nobody followed me.",	"player_2_3":"Whoa! This is none of my business, Nien. No.",	"player_3_1":"Why are you talking so weird?",	"player_3_2":"Why are you and Han Solo here on Lok?",	"player_3_3":"Is it true what they say about Han's ship?",	"player_reset_1":"Okay, I've had enough of this. I'm not doing this anymore.",	"player_sorry_1":"Umm... I think the answer is no, but I'm still looking?",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I do not see problems with this current status. Upon the acquisition of repair, all will be made better.",	"npc_reset_1":"The emotion of anger is projected at the malfunctioning device in question. With a viewing of the past, knowledge provides information to the effect that currency should not have parted my appendages for said object. Blessings be unto you regardless of the outcome.",	"cantwork":"Assistance has been offered, but a denial will ensue with gracious attachment. A thought comes to my mind that entails the visitation of Corellia.",	"dontknowyou_1":"Well, if you think of something you want, look for me sometime.",	"npc_work_1":"Has the position of the merchandiser of rubbish been acquired?",	"npc_work_2":"Have you taken care of the tag-a-long?",	"npc_work_3":"Were you able to stop the Pirates?",	"npc_breech_1":"Would you care to see my specially modified droid parts?",	"npc_breech_2":"So this is where secret Rebel base is, hm? The Empire will pay a lot for this info...",	"npc_breech_3":"Hey you!  Get out of here or get dead!",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Well, you'd best hurry before that bounty hunter gets too close to our makeshift base.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Well hurry up! They're pirates, for Sullust's sake! They're not going to wait around all day for someone to show up!",	"npc_reset_2":"I'm not too sure about that, friend. By the looks of the ship - and I got a pretty close look without being spotted, I'd say that's a bounty hunter after you. Then again, we are on Lok... I'd still rather be safe than sorry.",	"npc_reset_3":"How am I supposed to take them on!? I'm both a pilot and a navigator, I'm not a fighter!",	"player_reset_2":"I don't think anyone was following me. I'm not doing this.",	"player_reset_3":"I won't be able to stop them, Nein!",	"player_sorry_2":"Not yet, but I'll have it taken care of.",	"player_sorry_3":"No, I haven't left yet.",	"dontknowyou_2":"You're not the person I'm looking for. Get out of here!",	"dontknowyou_3":"Didn't you hear me the first time? I said my favorite line I like to say: Get out of here or get dead!!! That means go!",	"dontknowyou_4":"What? You're not the guy who wants to buy the Hyperdrive from me? Well, what are you wasting my time for?",	"npc_1_4":"Okay..... I've spoken to Chewbacca... the hyperdrive is heavily damaged, but he says he can get it fixed if he had the right parts. I've managed to get in touch with a few shady pirates on this planet, and one guy said he has the part. Could you run out there and grab it for me? I would greatly appreciate it...",	"npc_2_4":"Thank you so much! Okay, I've told him I'm sending you out there. You might want to keep an eye open. I don't really trust this guy... well, I don't really trust any of the people here on the planet, to be honest. Just make sure he doesn't try to rob you, okay?",	"npc_3_4":"Ah, I understand. I guess I'll see if Chewbacca can help m out. I really need to get the Falcon fixed before Han notices.",	"npc_4_4":"Are you crazy?! I'm never going to tell him. As a matter of fact, unless it's a matter of life or death, I'm never flying that thing again after we get off this planet! Even if we can stop the Empire once and for all, I won't get in his ship again. Well... I guess if we could stop the Empire I would... But that would be the ONLY way I'd fly his ship again!",	"npc_backtowork_4":"Okay, good. Make sure the part works before you accept it, okay?",	"npc_breech_4":"You the one picking up this hyperdrive part? Good......",	"npc_reset_4":"Ah, I understand. I guess I'll see if Chewbacca can help me out. I really need to get the Falcon fixed before Han notices.",	"npc_reward_4":"Friend, you've helped me so much today, I greatly appreciate it. I can't begin to thank you for your help. You're the type of person who reminds me why we fight against the Empire. Oh yeah... I forgot you were here to speak with Han. I'll let him know you're here, and I'll also let him know you're completely dependable, too.",	"npc_work_4":"So were you able to get the Hyperdrive?",	"player_1_4":"You're a nice guy... sure.",	"player_2_4":"Sorry, Nien, but I don't have time right now.",	"player_3_4":"Are you going to tell Han what happened?",	"player_reset_4":"Sorry, Nien, but I don't have time to help you right now. I can't do this.",	"player_sorry_4":"Not yet. I'm about to meet him right now.",	"gotowork":"Dunno what this is. Here, you can have it back.",	"npc_failure_1":"Understanding has eluded my grasp on the same height as yours.",	"npc_failure_2":"You led the bounty hunter straight here? Oh, I sure do hope it was just some local pirate, rather than someone working for the Empire.",	"npc_failure_3":"You let them steal the Falcon? YOU LET THEM STEAL THE FALCON?!?!?!? Oh, that's it... I've got to get off this planet before Han finds out!!!",	"npc_failure_4":"He didn't actually have a Hyperdrive for a YT-1300? Aaarrgg!!!!  What am I going to do now? *sigh* I guess I take my chances with telling him then...",	"npc_noloc_1":"Charts are in need of consulting before a quest is embarked upon.  Please refer back to me later.",	"npc_noloc_2":"Let me check the Falcon for my notes. Check back with me in a few minutes.",	"npc_noloc_3":"Let me look on this map to see where I hid the Falcon. Check back in a few minutes.",	"npc_noloc_4":"I need to find out where this place is that you're supposed to meet him. Check back with me in a few minutes, okay?",	"otherescort":"Whaaah? I don't know you! What do you want with me? Oh.... you must be looking for the other person standing around nearby.",	"npc_takeme_1":"Blast it! I told that Sullustan not to get that droid brain wet! Arrrgh.... sure, I'll fix it for him. Take me to him.",	"notyet":"I can't talk.  I'm too busy working for Princess Leia.  Well, I could talk to you if she said it was ok.  You know where she's at right?  Somewhere on Cor....oh.  I shouldn't say.",	"next":"Talk to Han.  See what he has to say.",	"notit_4":"Chewbacca cannot fix the hyderdrive without that part.  I really need you to pick it up for me.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"Bah... can't believe I let that go so cheaply. Get out of here before I change my mind."
