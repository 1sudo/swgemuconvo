		"cant_work":"You may find it rewarding to meet with me soon, after you are not so busy.",	"dontknowyou_1":"",	"dontknowyou_2":"",	"dontknowyou_3":"Bounty Hunter's Guild business. Don't get in my way.",	"gotowork_1":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"next":"All is proceeding according to plan. I no longer need your assistance.",	"notit_1":"",	"notit_2":"",	"notit_3":"",	"notyet":"My time is valuable and you, obviously, are not worthy of it. Only a servant of the Empire will be of any use to me.",	"npc_1_1":"Ahh -- you are here to help my Cyber-Rancor project? To augment the Empire's forces with an unstoppable legion of mechano-organic monstrosities? How good. I have located a minor specimen in the wild. If you kill this rancor, I shall reward you and assign you further work.",	"npc_1_2":"Ah, you again. A pack of thieves has stolen one of my valuable research animals, a rancor of unusual genetic heritage. I urge you to pursue the thieves, kill them, and return the rancor here safely.",	"npc_1_3":"Oh, dear. I understand that the Ithorian do-gooder naturalist, Wallaw somebody, has actually hired a bounty hunter to kill me. What a nuisance. Can you dispose of this bounty hunter and his team for me?",	"npc_2_1":"Very well. The specimen is evidently old and somewhat deformed, but may still present a challenge. Be wary.",	"npc_2_2":"Good. Assemble your team and move quickly. Return the rancor here -- it should follow you tamely.",	"npc_2_3":"Good. I shall reward you upon your return here.",	"npc_3_1":"Then waste no more of my time, imbecile.",	"npc_3_2":"Then bother me no more.",	"npc_3_3":"After your previous aid to the cause of science, I am disappointed.",	"npc_4_1":"Genetic material, you buffoon! I shall send out a bioengineer team to secure the slain rancor's genetic stock for later cloning and mechanization. Soon every rancor on Dathomir may lend its genes to my plan. Will you destroy this single specimen?",	"npc_4_2":"Regrettably, some Ithorian do-gooder naturalist at the Trade Outpost has taken it into his malformed head to obstruct my work. Claims it would depopulate Dathomir of rancors -- as though that were a bad thing. He hired these thieves. Will you return the test rancor here and ensure his silly goals remain unmet?",	"npc_4_3":"I'd -- I would prefer not to involve my superiors in this embarrassing little fracas. I fear a certain loss of reputation and consequent budget reductions. Really, I'm sure an agent with your capacities can handle one bounty hunter and a few hired terrorists. Will you?",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"My team implanted a control chip in the creature's brain, rendering it docile. After you destroy its captors, simply speak to it in a firm voice and it will follow you blindly. Return it here.",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"My probe droids show four individuals, apparently fairly well-armed. You may need a small strike team to dispatch them. Will you do it?",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I have told you everything necessary. You must destroy the rancor specimen to secure my approval.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"I have told you everything pertinent. Rescue my valuable test rancor from those thieves.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"There is nothing more to explain. Simply stop that bounty hunter so I can return to my research with a clear mind.",	"npc_breech_1":"",	"npc_breech_2":"You're not here for that Rancor are you?  Hah!  We already \"disposed\" of that!  Now it's your turn!",	"npc_breech_3":"Enemy sighted. Fire at will.",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_failure_1":"You did not destroy that single rancor specimen? I very much fear I have no work for someone of such mean qualifications.",	"npc_failure_2":"You did not rescue my test rancor? This is a blow to science.",	"npc_failure_3":"Dear, dear. I suppose I shall have to alert my superiors about this bounty hunter. What a nuisance.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_1_3":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Ah, one moment. I'm receiving a report of interesting experimental results. Talk to me again shortly.",	"npc_noloc_2":"Drat. My probe droid has malfunctioned. When its repair circuits activate, I shall have the rancor's coordinates. Talk to me again shortly.",	"npc_noloc_3":"I am awaiting a report from my probe droid on the bounty hunter's whereabouts. Then I shall have coordinates for you. Talk to me shortly.",	"npc_reset":"I have little patience with quitters. Still, I am short-handed, so stop by again when you feel ready.",	"npc_reward_1":"My probe droids relayed your efficient dispatch of the creature. I reward you appropriately, and desire you to contact me again for further assignments.",	"npc_reward_2":"Ah, that's too bad.  They killed it, eh?  Well you did your job well enough anyway.",	"npc_reward_3":"The bounty hunter is dead? A relief. Now I can return to breeding my army of cyber-rancors. Oh, you'll want a reward, I suppose? Here.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_work_1":"I expect you to destroy that rancor specimen. I would have hoped you'd be on your way already.",	"npc_work_2":"I expect you to rescue my valuable test rancor from those thieves. What's keeping you?",	"npc_work_3":"I certainly hope you can dispose of that nuisance bounty hunter before long.",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"",	"otherescort_3":"",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_1":"Why do you want me to kill this rancor? How can you use a dead one?",	"player_3_2":"Who hired these thieves to take the test rancor from you?",	"player_3_3":"Why not get the Empire to cancel the bounty hunter's contract, or just kill the hunter for you?",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"How, exactly, do I rescue a rancor?",	"player_4_3":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"How strong is the team that kidnapped your rancor?",	"player_5_3":"",	"player_more_1_1":"",	"player_more_1_2":"",	"player_more_1_3":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_2_3":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_more_3_3":"",	"player_reset":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"This Imperial scientist awaits a report of the destruction of the gnarled rancor, so that he can harvest its genetic material for his planned army of cyber-rancors.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"This Imperial scientist awaits the safe return of his stolen test rancor, or information about what happened.",	"return_waypoint_description_3":"This Imperial scientist awaits news of the bounty hunter hired to terminate him and his cyber-rancor research program.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Shibb Nisshil",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Shibb Nisshil",	"return_waypoint_name_3":"Shibb Nisshil",	"waypoint_description_1":"Imperial scientist Shibb Nisshil wants this rancor destroyed so he can harvest its genetic material for his planned army of cyber-rancors.",	"waypoint_description_2":"Thieves have taken Imperial scientist Shibb Nisshil's mutated rancor. He wants the thieves killed and the rancor returned safely to him.",	"waypoint_description_3":"Imperial scientist Shibb Nisshil wants to stop this bounty hunter, who was hired by an Ithorian naturalist to terminate Nisshil and his cyber-rancor experiments.",	"waypoint_name_1":"Gnarled Rancor",	"waypoint_name_2":"Test Rancor",	"waypoint_name_3":"Bounty Hunter",	"npc_reset_1":"I have little patience with quitters. Still, I am short-handed, so stop by again when you feel ready.",	"npc_reset_2":"I have little patience with quitters. Still, I am short-handed, so stop by again when you feel ready.",	"npc_reset_3":"I have little patience with quitters.
