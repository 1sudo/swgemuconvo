I have little time for you if you're not. One of my rancors has escaped from its pen. These creatures take years to train and I don't want to lose all the work that went into this one. Could you help me get it back?",	"npc_1_2":"It appears that Singing Mountain Clan has been raiding our territory looking for rancor nests. They are probably also responsible for freeing the rancors from their pens. I need someone to wipe this raiding party out. Could you handle that?",	"npc_2_1":"My scouts reported unusual rancor activity in this area. Go and check it out. If you find my rancor, bring it back here.",	"npc_2_2":"Head to these coordinates. The Singing Mountain Clan's raiding party should be there. Wipe them all out. This will not be easy so you might wish to bring allies.",	"npc_3_1":"Why do you waste my time then? Away with you.",	"npc_3_2":"I believe you are correct. You probably can't handle a Singing Mountain Clan raiding party.",	"npc_4_1":"Normally yes, but I've sprayed you with a musk that the rancor will recognize.

Claim your reward.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_work_1":"Have you found my rancor?
