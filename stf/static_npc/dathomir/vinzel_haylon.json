		"cant_work":"If you're the Assistant to the Warden the Empire has sent, I need you on the double. I can't have you running around doing other tings as casually as you please.",	"dontknowyou_1":"Go.. go away....",	"dontknowyou_2":"Thanks for not bringing us back in.",	"dontknowyou_3":"Please go before I threaten you again.",	"dontknowyou_4":"Nevermind.",	"gotowork_1":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"next":"You did a good job. It's a shame you're trapped here on this planet just as I am am. You could have gone far in the Empire.",	"notit_1":"What's this? I don't remember asking for this? Quit fooling around and get back to work.",	"notit_2":"What's this? I don't need this. What I do need is those inmates back here, and back here on the double.",	"notit_3":"I didn't ask for this. Take it back.",	"notit_4":"I don't want this. Take it back.",	"notyet":"I don't know who you've been assigned to, but I know it's not me. Go find your officer and get back to work.",	"npc_1_1":"Well, don't just stand there! You're the new officer I was told to expect, right? Well, we've got 'The Brain' coming back in. This time, we won't let him escape. It's straight to solitary, where he'll spend the rest of his days. I need you to pick him up, understand?",	"npc_1_2":"You've shown up just in time. We have a prison break and they're still running around throughout the forests. I've sent some troopers to find them, but I'd appreciate it if you helped.",	"npc_1_3":"I've finished interrogating Teen, and it seems he had some outside help. One of those frightening Nightsisters helped Teen and his friends get out. I need you to go take care of her before she steals my shuttle. Can you do it?",	"npc_1_4":"We have really bad news. 'The Brain' managed to escape again, but this time he's made a lot of noise about it. We now have a riot on our hands. I need your help with this.",	"npc_2_1":"We've had to drop him off far from the prison so that the other prisoners don't manage to see him. Don't worry, he's been given a number of sedatives, so he should be quite willing to come.",	"npc_2_2":"Thank you. Now look, there should be a couple of them. Bring the guy who looks like the leader of the group. I need to bring him back so he can be made an example in front of the others.",	"npc_2_3":"Good. Now, I know where she's going to be. Fortunately, we have time before she can figure out the controls of the ship she's trying to leave from. You need to make sure she doesn't leave... ever.",	"npc_2_4":"We have most of the prisoners contained at this point, but there are a group of others that are holding out somewhere. I want them dead.",	"npc_3_1":"Oh really? If I have the wrong person then who are you? I've never seen you around here before, which would mean you managed to get here onto this planet somehow. I'm going to take care of this situation, then I'll have some questions.",	"npc_3_2":"Same here, but I need as many free hands. The longer they're out there, the better of a chance they'll have to secure weapons. They need to be brought back, Think about it, please.",	"npc_3_3":"I don't blame you, but I can't do it myself, either. We have a better chance of surprising her if we send just you, rather than a whole host Stormtroopers. Please reconsider.",	"npc_3_4":"Look, I need your help. These prisoners are dangerous and could hurt one of you tourists. What do you mean you're not going to help?",	"npc_4_1":"You don't know who The Brain is? His name is Ezker Keanin, and he's solely responsible for setting free 3 full shipments of Wookiee slaves destined for Kessel. He's already escaped here once, as well. If the prisoners see that he's back, that might inspire them.... and I don't want to see that happen.",	"npc_4_2":"I still don't know yet. We found them missing a few hours ago is all we know right now. I know one of them was Teen Queevello, an inmate responsible enough to clean my offices. I don't know what caused him to rebel.",	"npc_4_3":"Yes, that is the only possible way off the planet, and the Nightsisters want desperately to leave. By the way, how did you and everyone else manage to get onto this planet?",	"npc_4_4":"Hope. Plain and simple hope. That's all it took for the rest of these guys to rise up against us. When the Nightsisters attacked us, we've been severely understaffed since then. All the prisoners needed was hope to make them think of rising up against us.",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_5_4":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_6_4":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"You need to hike your buttout to the drop point where we're bringing in 'The Brain'. Once you have him, bring him back here.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"You need to go out and find the escaped convicts. Once you find them, bring them back. If they put up a fight, make sure at least one lives.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"You need to stop the Nightsister from escaping via the only possible way off of this planet.",	"npc_backtowork_4":"You need to go out there and kill the rioting prisoners.",	"npc_breech_1":"I feel so wierd.... why can't think straight? Who are you?",	"npc_breech_2":"Look, you don't have to bring us back. Just walk away and let us go!",	"npc_breech_3":"I will learn how this magical flying machine works, and you will not stop me!",	"npc_breech_4":"Kill any Imperial on sight!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"Where is this? Why is it so dark here?",	"npc_dropoff_2":"Thanks, friend. I hope my screams help you to sleep every night. You could have just let us go.",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_failure_1":"You let him escape? Well, I knew that idea was just plain foolish to begin with. Very well... we'll have to send out the dogs.",	"npc_failure_2":"You let them all die? That's not good! Now the inmates won't believe that they were captured and they all might start getting funny ideas in thier heads.",	"npc_failure_3":"She managed to escape?? NO!!! Now she might set up a system of shuttles that depart regularly from the planet. Soon, all those witches will leave the planet!!!",	"npc_failure_4":"The prisoners have taken over the building? How am I going to explain this.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_1_3":"",	"npc_more_1_4":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_2_4":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_more_3_4":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Let me check with the flight logs to see  where he was being dropped in. Ask me in a few minutes.",	"npc_noloc_2":"Let me see if we have any sightings yet on the whereabouts of the prisoners. Ask me again in a few minutes.",	"npc_noloc_3":"Let me remember where I parked my shuttle. Ask me again in a few minutes.",	"npc_noloc_4":"Something happened. Ask me again in a few minutes.",	"npc_reset":"Really now? Did you think I was that dumb? I'm quite familiar with who you are. You just don't come to Dathomir and expect to leave, friend. Think about that.",	"npc_reward_1":"Good work. I hope he wasn't too much trouble for you. Fortunately there hasn't been anyone talking about him coming back, so the prisoners don't know he's here. He'll be in solitary for the rest of his time here, which like everyone else, is forever.",	"npc_reward_2":"You were only able to bring Teen back? Very well, this will do. Sadly, Teen was given many liberties most inmates aren't given. Now he'll be flogged everyday in front of the other prisoners to show what happens to escapees. Well, good work, friend.",	"npc_reward_3":"Good. With her being stopped, the Nightsisters will never leave this planet. They are trapped here just like me and you.",	"npc_reward_4":"Well, now that the riot's under control, we can start restoring order to the prison again. Thanks for your help, friend.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"My head... must... think... straight... You're taking me somewhere, aren't you?",	"npc_takeme_2":"Fine... take me back. You know they'll kill me, right?",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_work_1":"Have you brought him into your custody yet?",	"npc_work_2":"Are you leaving to capture them yet?",	"npc_work_3":"Why haven't you stopped her yet?",	"npc_work_4":"Have you taken care of the prisoners?",	"otherescort_1":"No, there is another person around here that you're looking for.",	"otherescort_2":"I'm not the one you're looking for.",	"otherescort_3":"",	"otherescort_4":"",	"player_1_1":"Yes sir. Where can I find him?",	"player_1_2":"I'll go help.",	"player_1_3":"Sure, I'll do it.",	"player_1_4":"I'll help. ",	"player_2_1":"Sorry, you've got the wrong person.",	"player_2_2":"Sorry, that's a little out of my league.",	"player_2_3":"I'm not tangling with a Nightsister! No.",	"player_2_4":"That's too much for me.",	"player_3_1":"Who is the prisoner?",	"player_3_2":"How did they manage to escape?",	"player_3_3":"You have a shuttle?",	"player_3_4":"How did this happen?",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"",	"player_4_3":"",	"player_4_4":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"",	"player_5_3":"",	"player_5_4":"",	"player_more_1_1":"",	"player_more_1_2":"",	"player_more_1_3":"",	"player_more_1_4":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_2_3":"",	"player_more_2_4":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_more_3_3":"",	"player_more_3_4":"",	"player_reset":"I can't do this. I'm not who you think I am.",	"player_sorry":"Sir, what was I to do again?",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"Now bring him back to the Warden before the drugs wear off.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"Bring back the prisoner to the Warden punishment.",	"return_waypoint_description_3":"The Warden is waiting for you to report back",	"return_waypoint_description_4":"Return to let him know that the riot is over",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"The Warden",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"The Warden",	"return_waypoint_name_3":"The Warden",	"return_waypoint_name_4":"The Warden",	"waypoint_description_1":"You will pick up 'The Brain' at this location",	"waypoint_description_2":"A group of people were spotted around this area.",	"waypoint_description_3":"You should be able to find the Nightsister here",	"waypoint_description_4":"This is where you'll find a group of rioting prisoners",	"waypoint_name_1":"Drugged Prisoner",	"waypoint_name_2":"Escaped Fugitives",	"waypoint_name_3":"Escaping Nightsister",	"waypoint_name_4":"Rioting Prisoners",	"npc_reset_1":"Really now? Did you think I was that dumb? I'm quite familiar with who you are. You just don't come to Dathomir and expect to leave, friend. Think about that.",	"npc_reset_2":"Really now?
