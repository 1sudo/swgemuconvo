		"cant_work":"When you get some free time, please come and speak to me again. I may have tasks for you.",	"dontknowyou_1":"I'm a bit busy, pal.",	"dontknowyou_2":"Can't help you, friend.",	"gotowork_1":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"next":"You have served me well, offworlder. Visit me from time to time and perhaps I'll have more tasks for you.",	"notit_1":"",	"notit_2":"",	"notyet":"",	"npc_1_1":"Greetings, offworlder. I am known among my sisters as Zideera. I am apprenticed to Huntress Vhaunda. Recently my mistress has become cross with me due to my growing interest in offworlders, particularly of the male variety. I have explained that I am only curious for they seem quite strange to me - strange but not unappealing. There is one in particular who has fascinated me and now finds himself in need of aid. I cannot aid him myself - my mistress would punish me harshly. Could you help him?",	"npc_1_2":"My pirate friend has informed me that one of his crewmates has contacted him. It seems my pirate friend needs to return to his people to continue plying his trade. Will you bring my pirate friend's crewman back here? It will be safer for them if they can travel back to his ship together.",	"npc_2_1":"Excellent. I believe his ship was shot down by an Imperial patrol. One of my scout sisters gave me the coordinates of the crash. Could you go there and bring this male back here safely?",	"npc_2_2":"Excellent. Please hurry. I hear that the Nightsisters have sent a raiding party to investigate the ship's landing. They tend to kill offworlders they encounter in the wilds.",	"npc_3_1":"How sad. I would hate to lose this fascinating male. He has proven a most interesting specimen to study.",	"npc_3_2":"And just when I was beginning to like you. What a shame.",	"npc_4_1":"I believe you would refer to him as a pirate. He preys upon the weak members of your kind, which is good since this would serve to cull your herd. Correct?",	"npc_4_2":"My mistress does not know he's still here. I'm hiding him, you see. It would be bad for both of us if she were to discover him.",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"I'll tell her they arrived together and wish to trade with our clan.",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"Where males are concerned, it's quite necessary. She does not understand my fascination with them and I cannot explain it. I've asked my pirate friend to show her but he's convinced that's not a wise idea.",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I have nothing further to tell you.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Why do you delay? Please find the shipmate.",	"npc_breech_1":"Over here! Get these blasted creatures off me!",	"npc_breech_2":"Over here! Are you the one that will take me to my captain?",	"npc_dropoff_1":"I owe you one, friend. I hope I get a chance to repay you someday.",	"npc_dropoff_2":"Much obliged, friend. If we ever cross paths again, I hope to remember your kindness.",	"npc_failure_1":"Where will I find another male as fascinating as that pirate? His greeting customs were most delightful.",	"npc_failure_2":"Now I shall have to continue to hide my pirate friend in my hut. I suppose that is not entirely bad.",	"npc_more_1_1":"Let's just say that I know how to treat the ladies right. Learn to do that and you'll go far in this galaxy.",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"I must verify the pirate's location. Come back in a few moments.",	"npc_noloc_2":"One moment while I verify the shipmate's location with my pirate friend.",	"npc_reset":"Come back when you can finish what you begin.",	"npc_reward_1":"I thank you for bringing him back to me. Please keep this to yourself and accept this as a reward.",	"npc_reward_2":"Thank you for your help. Please accept this as payment for your services.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"A good thing you came when you did, friend. If your goal is to bring me back to that lovely lass Zideera, then lead on.",	"npc_takeme_2":"Let's get a move on, friend. The noises in this place are enough to send shivers up my spine.",	"npc_work_1":"Did you find my missing pirate?",	"npc_work_2":"Did you find my pirate friend's shipmate?",	"otherescort_1":"I'm not the fellow you're looking for.",	"otherescort_2":"You aren't looking for me, stranger.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_1":"Who is this offworlder?",	"player_3_2":"Why doesn't your pirate friend simply go out to meet his shipmate?",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"Won't she discover him when the shipmate arrives?",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"You've gotten good at lying to your mistress, haven't you?",	"player_more_1_1":"Why is Zideera so taken with you?",	"player_more_1_2":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_reset":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"Escort the pirate back to Zideera.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"Escort the shipmate back to Zideera.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Zideera's Location",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Zideera's Location",	"waypoint_description_1":"Rescue the stranded pirate before he's eaten by rancors.",	"waypoint_description_2":"Find the shipmate before the Nightsisters do.",	"waypoint_name_1":"Stranded Pirate's Location",	"waypoint_name_2":"Pirate Shipmate's Location",	"npc_reset_1":"Come back when you can finish what you begin.",	"npc_reset_2":"Come back when you can finish what you begin.",	"npc_reset_3":"Come back when you can finish what you begin.",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission."
