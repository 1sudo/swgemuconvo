		"cant_work":"Ah... your mind is preoccupied... Hahaha... you will be an easy one. You will remember to come back to me when you are not so distracted...",	"dontknowyou_1":"Look at the mess you made! Get out of here before the reinforcements come.",	"dontknowyou_2":"Oh, you're not here to pick me up? Nevermind, then.",	"gotowork_1":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"next":"My little pet, I am sad to see you go, yet the Clan Mother wishes to use you for her own ends. Oh... I could have treated you so much better... very well, I release you, and I will let you remember everything, as well.... hahaha.... Now, go see the Mother!",	"notit_1":"Oh, you are so cute, little one. You wish to shower me in gifts... no, you may keep that one for yourself.",	"notit_2":"No, pet, I do not want this.",	"notit_3":"I don't want this, you stupid little pet! Now go do what I said.",	"notyet":"Ah... your mind is preoccupied... Hahaha... you will be an easy one. You will remember to come back to me when you are not so distracted...",	"npc_1_1":"I have heard of your name spoken in whispers among the Sisters. You want to help me, don't you? You will feel more complete by offering your help, and want to give in to my every desire....",	"npc_1_2":"I am sickened to hear what has recently happened. It seems the Singing Mountain Sisters know not how to leave well enough alone. Very well, I shall set my pet upon them, won't I?",	"npc_1_3":"Oh, the Empire is quite effective indeed, aren't they? They have already sent someone to replace my 'toy'. Perhaps this one might know how to leave our beautiful planet this time. Pet! Go fetch this one for me!",	"npc_2_1":"Yes, you are a good little one, aren't you? You will now bring me the newest arrival to the Imperial Prison. He is quite handsome, and I have not had a fun toy to play with for a while. Do not make me wait long...",	"npc_2_2":"Yes, it pleases you more than anything to do so. Go find the Nightsister who has fallen sway to the Singing Mountain's silly preachings, then bring her back to me. You may do as you please to the other Sisters there.",	"npc_2_3":"So willing... you are such a good pet, aren't you? Now, go bring him here unharmed and maybe I'll give you a treat... you'd like that, wouldn't you?",	"npc_3_1":"Oh... you are stronger than you look. Hmmm... I don't know whether to be angry or to view you as a challenge. I do so fear if I try any harder, I might shatter your little mind...",	"npc_3_2":"Oh, broken my compulsion, have you? You think you're clever, don't you? Hahaha... you are in the heart of our home, and you think you're going to walk out of here? Not so clever after all, are you?",	"npc_3_3":"So. You could have remained happy being my pet, but instead you choose to have it this way... very well then... let me see how you plan on leaving our stronghold, little pet.",	"npc_4_1":"I am helping you, little one. I am helping you to see that you cannot be happy unless you fulfill my whims... Anything I want, I deserve... I am helping you to see that. You like it when I help you, don't you? And now you want to help me.",	"npc_4_2":"The loathsome Singing Sisters have had the audacity to persuade one of our Sisters forsake the use of the Shadow Magics! This will not do. How dare they try to play with the mind of a Nightsister!! Who do they think they are?",	"npc_4_3":"There is a whole galaxy out there, little pet, which I think you very well know. The Sisters only wish to visit your people and bring them our culture. If they refuse... *sigh*... then we will have to kill them. I know they will be happy with us as their rulers.",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"You will be a good little pet and fetch me the Officer that has arrived at the prison so that I may... entertain myself.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"You are to fetch that impudent little girl who now claims to be a Singing Sister... and then I will deal with her.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Go and fetch this new officer who is replacing the last one. Bring him back to me relatively unharmed.",	"npc_breech_1":"What's going on here? Who are you? Guards, protect me!",	"npc_breech_2":"Oh no!!! I've been found out! Please, just let me go!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"Who is this? Is this one of those Nightsisters? Whatever you want of me, you will not have it!",	"npc_dropoff_2":"Baritha, I'm so sorry.... I'm so very sorry... I'm sorry.... please don't hurt me....  pleaaasee......",	"npc_failure_1":"Bad, bad, bad pet!!! I told you to bring me a toy, and you have failed me. Perhaps I will tire of you and find a new pet.",	"npc_failure_2":"You didn't bring her here? This make me very angry... VERY angry. Do you know what I do to my pets when they make me angry?",	"npc_failure_3":"You stupid little creature! I gave you a simple task, and you couldn't even do that!",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Let us wait for him to emerge from his sanctuary, shall we?  Come back to me in a little while.",	"npc_noloc_2":"She will be meeting with her co-conspirators soon. Come back to me and I will tell you when you will want to leave.",	"npc_noloc_3":"You will wait until he is less guarded. Ask me again in a little while when you should leave to do so.",	"npc_reset":"Ahhh... a fiesty one.... well, this changes things, doesn't it? Now think carefully about what I am about to say. Either join me... or die.",	"npc_reward_1":"Oh, he is a strong looking one, isn't he? I hope this one will be more of a challenge this time.... you have done well, my precious pet. You may please me again in the future. For now, leave me.",	"npc_reward_2":"Oh, you brought her back here. Here, let me pat you on the head, precious pet. You did good, didn't you? Yes, you did good... Now, as for you, Sister, you will learn the price of your mistake. Leave me, pet.",	"npc_reward_3":"Ah... he has the look of someone important... very good, pet. Now, go to your corner and sit there until Ihave further need of you.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"Where are you taking me? I command you, Let me go at once. Oh... you have a weapon. Very well, lead on",	"npc_takeme_2":"No, please! You don't know what she'll do to me!! Please...please, I beg you... if you have any soul, please let me gooooo!!!!!!",	"npc_work_1":"Yes, little pet?",	"npc_work_2":"Yes, my precious pet?",	"npc_work_3":"Yes, my precious pet?",	"otherescort_1":"I am not the person you are looking for.",	"otherescort_2":"Nope, I'm not the one you're looking for. I think the other one's over there.",	"player_1_1":"What's going on he--.......... yesss...

You have no power over me.",	"player_sorry":"Mistress, what do you wish of me?",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"You want to return the Imperial to Baritha. There is nothing more in the world you want.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"Your dark mistress wishes you to hurry. You don't want to keep her waiting, do you?",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Baritha",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Baritha",	"waypoint_description_1":"Apparently Baritha has chosen this person to be a 'toy', whatever she means by that.",	"waypoint_description_2":"This is where you will find the traitor.
