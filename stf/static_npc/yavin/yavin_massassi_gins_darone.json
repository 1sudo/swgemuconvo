		"cant_work":"You look like an experienced servant of the Empire. I'm prepared to employ you once you're available.",	"dontknowyou_1":"Can't help you, friend.",	"dontknowyou_2":"Clear out, citizen.",	"dontknowyou_3":"",	"gotowork_1":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"next":"The situation here has been normalized. I don't need help right now.",	"notit_1":"You were supposed to bring me a stranded Rebel's weapon. What are you bothering me with this for?",	"notit_2":"You were supposed to bring me a Rebel Special Forces sergeant's weapon, which I believe may change the course of the Civil War. That clearly isn't it!",	"notit_3":"",	"notyet":"I'm not able to deal with you right now.",	"npc_1_1":"As part of the Empire's salvage operation on Yavin 4, I'm hunting the Rebels and their secret weapon. Our probes just sighted a Rebel squad that apparently got stranded in the jungle. They may have been retrieving the weapon from a hidden cache. I want you to assemble a team, hit them hard, and take the weapon.",	"npc_1_2":"You're back? We've located a Rebel Special Forces squad that, in my view, could very likely be carrying the Rebellion's secret terror weapon that destroyed the Death Star. I want you to take an experienced team and bring back that weapon.",	"npc_1_3":"You again. At long last, I believe we've located the Rebels' secret weapon that blew up the Death Star -- or at least the lab where they built it. This stronghold may be preparing another weapon even as we speak! It's up to you to take out the scientist!",	"npc_2_1":"Good. I'm counting on you to render this situation normalized. Report back here with the weapon.",	"npc_2_2":"Excellent! I advise you to approach with a strong team and attack from surprise. Take no chances with this galaxy-changing weapon!",	"npc_2_3":"Good. I'll wait here for you to return with your report of the secret weapons scientist's demise.",	"npc_3_1":"I have no time for slackers.",	"npc_3_2":"You have missed your chance to change history. I pity you.",	"npc_3_3":"If you no longer believe in this cause, then it's best you get out.",	"npc_4_1":"Because the Death Star didn't just blow up by itself, now did it? Enough silly questions! Will you help the Empire or not?",	"npc_4_2":"Well, what else would a Special Forces squad be doing here? Just hunting Imperials? I think not! This is our chance to seize the weapon that can annihilate the Rebellion! Will you seize this chance at glory?",	"npc_4_3":"There has to be a super weapon! If there isn't, why would the Empire be expending such enormous resources to find it? Hah? Answer me that. That's right, you can't. Now will you destroy this weapons lab or not?",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Enough chatter. Destroy those Rebels and retrieve their secret weapon!",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Enough talking. I expect to hear shortly of the Rebel Special Forces squad dying in battle.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"No more talk. That Rebel weapons lab could be creating another super weapon as we speak. Destroy the lab!",	"npc_breech_1":"Enemy sighted!",	"npc_breech_2":"An Imperial! Fire!",	"npc_breech_3":"Imperials!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_failure_1":"You didn't defeat those Rebels? That could have been the super weapon, slipping through our fingers!",	"npc_failure_2":"With the Civil War hanging in the balance, you may have let the ultimate weapon slip through your clumsy fingers!",	"npc_failure_3":"You couldn't take out that Rebel weapons lab? They could be readying their super weapon to blow up this entire moon!",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_1_3":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"I'm awaiting updated coordinates from the probes. Check with me in a moment.",	"npc_noloc_2":"I am awaiting current coordinates for the Rebel Special Forces squad. Talk to me again in a moment.",	"npc_noloc_3":"Wait -- I have to take this call from my superiors. They apparently need reassurance that it's worthwhile to hunt for the Rebels' super weapon. Hah! Talk to me again in a moment.",	"npc_reset_1":"The Empire didn't get where it is today by slacking! Return here when you're ready to test your mettle.",	"npc_reward_1":"No super weapon this time. But there could have been! To find a secret weapon, you have to follow every possible lead. Check with me soon for more leads.",	"npc_reward_2":"Hmm. Well, at least we can cross one more lead off a long list. But we'll find that weapon! If we have to burn the jungle to the ground, we'll find it! And you'll help, if you talk to me again.",	"npc_reward_3":"All right, so it was just a listening post. But you can never -- never -- be sure. Now leave me alone, I have to figure out how to explain this to my superiors.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_work_1":"I expect you to attack those stranded Rebels and bring back their leader's weapon. Get moving!",	"npc_work_2":"I have heard no report of the Rebel Special Forces squad dying in battle. Why not?",	"npc_work_3":"Is something holding you back from destroying that Rebel weapons lab? Something more important than the end of the Civil War?",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"",	"otherescort_3":"",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_1":"Why do you think the Rebels have a secret weapon?",	"player_3_2":"Why do you think this Special Forces squad is carrying the secret weapon?",	"player_3_3":"After all this time, you still think the Rebels have a secret weapon?",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"",	"player_4_3":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"",	"player_5_3":"",	"player_more_1_1":"",	"player_more_1_2":"",	"player_more_1_3":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_2_3":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_more_3_3":"",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"This Imperial officer is waiting for the stranded Rebels' weapon, which he believes may have destroyed the Death Star.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"This Imperial officer awaits a weapon secured from a Rebel Special Forces sergeant. Darone hopes this is the secret device that destroyed the Death Star.",	"return_waypoint_description_3":"This Imperial officer is waiting for a report on the destroyed Rebel listening post, which he believed was a weapons lab that built a super weapon.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Lt. Cmdr Gins Darone",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Lt. Cmdr. Gins Darone",	"return_waypoint_name_3":"Lt. Cmdr. Gins Darone",	"waypoint_description_1":"Imperial Lt. Cmdr. Gins Darone believes this squad of Rebel Alliance soldiers may be carrying the secret weapon that destroyed the Death Star.",	"waypoint_description_2":"A squad of Rebel Alliance Special Forces soldiers, possibly carrying a secret weapon desired by Imperial Lt. Cmdr. Gins Darone.",	"waypoint_description_3":"According to Imperial Lt. Cmdr. Gins Darone, the Rebel Alliance may have used this installation to build the super weapon that destroyed the Death Star.",	"waypoint_name_1":"Stranded Rebel Squad",	"waypoint_name_2":"Rebel Special Forces",	"waypoint_name_3":"Rebel Weapons Lab?",	"npc_reset_2":"The Empire didn't get where it is today by slacking! Return here when you're ready to test your mettle.",	"npc_reset_3":"The Empire didn't get where it is today by slacking! Return here when you're ready to test your mettle.",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission."
