		"cant_work":"Looks like you're working hard. I like to see that. Come back when you're not so busy - I've got some more work for you.",	"dontknowyou_1":"Nice weather we've been having, hmm?",	"dontknowyou_2":"",	"dontknowyou_3":"Who are you? No, I should be all right on my own now.",	"gotowork_1":"You wouldn't happen to have a secondary flux modulator for an IT series mineral scanner, would you?",	"gotowork_2":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"next":"Well, things are certainly a lot easier around here since you showed up. I'm sorry, but I just don't have anything else for you to do.",	"notit_1":"This isn't what I asked for. Stop fooling around.",	"notit_2":"You're not done yet.",	"notit_3":"This isn't what I asked for.",	"notyet":"Is there something I can help you with? We're all very busy around here, and don't have much time to talk to strangers.",	"npc_1_1":"Three hours? Three hours and they just now let us know the dang thing is busted? Unbelievable. Now where am I going to find someone to... hey, you! Yeah. How would you like to earn a few credits running a replacement part out to a surveying team?",	"npc_1_2":"There's been a fair bit of excitement around the old camp since you left. Anglers. Two or three of the nasty Sithspawn came in from the jungle. Made off with our pack kaadu. It wasn't cheap importing that thing all the way from Naboo, either. But the point is, we can't have these sort of goings-on. How do you feel about killing a few anglers?",	"npc_1_3":"You haven't let me down yet, and for the sake of my men I hope you don't start now. That surveying team you helped out before is being attacked by a rabid pack of choku. I need you to get out there and rescue as many of them as you can.",	"npc_2_1":"That's just fantastic. You run this briefcase out to the jokers standing about near the location I've marked on your datapad, and I'll give you a few credits.",	"npc_2_2":"Hey, this isn't a situation you should approach lightly. Those anglers will eat a person just the same as a kaadu. I have faith in you, though. One of my men followed the things back to their den. I'll mark the location on your datapad. Stop by after you're done and I'll see you get your reward.",	"npc_2_3":"Good. Hurry, there's no time to waste. You know what to expect: choku are meaner than a sack full of womp rats. Still, I know you've got it in you.",	"npc_3_1":"Okay then. If you're not going to help, would you mind not getting in the way?",	"npc_3_2":"Hmm. Well, we should be safe for a while. Kaadu meat is very filling from what I hear. I do wish you would reconsider. Soon.",	"npc_3_3":"It seems I overestimated you. I just regret that it figured into the loss of my men.",	"npc_4_1":"It's just a quick trip to a few surveyors. It's nothing dangerous, but we have plenty of work to do. I'd rather not send one of my men out if I can avoid it. And I'm prepared to pay you well.",	"npc_4_2":"I don't blame you for thinking about number one. Anglers can be pretty tricky. Well, I've got a few credits for you. And there's this set of old mining coveralls I found in the storeroom. They look to be about your size.",	"npc_4_3":"How could you think of payment when the lives of my men are on the line? Are you really that mercenary? Sad. Yes, I will pay you if you save my men.",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I'd say you should.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"I ddin't think they were.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Yes, please do.",	"npc_breech_1":"Hey, are you the courier that Jazeen sent?",	"npc_breech_2":"",	"npc_breech_3":"Spare me... spare me. My child, my wife... Please help me!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_3":"I'm alive... but I'll be needing a visit to the infirmary. Thank you... for all you've done. You're a true hero.",	"npc_failure_1":"This is what I get for asking a stranger to help me. Well, you know what they say about wanting something done right.",	"npc_failure_2":"Well, it happens to the best of us. Don't let it get you down. Maybe you should try again?",	"npc_failure_3":"It seems I overestimated you. I just regret that it figured into the loss of my men.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_1_3":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Hey, give me a minute. Those fools weren't at the right place. Come back a little later, okay?",	"npc_noloc_2":"Hold on a minute, comlink going off... Jazeen here... Ah, Sithspit! All right, you keep an eye on them and let me know when they've stopped. Out. -- Well, hold your horses. Seems those beasties got the idea to up and move. Check back with me a little later and I'll let you know if they've stopped.",	"npc_noloc_3":"Hold on lad. They're running for their lives. We're trying to track their movement. Sit tight a minute, I'll let you know when we find them.",	"npc_reset_1":"Very well then, forget I even asked.",	"npc_reward_1":"Hey, not bad. Not bad at all. You came through for me kid, I'll remember this. Here are those credits we talked about.",	"npc_reward_2":"You got them, eh? Another job well done. The camp'll be safe for the time being. Here ya go.",	"npc_reward_3":"I know you did the best you could, and I'm thankful for that. You've done a great thing today. I don't think of too many people this way, but I believe the men are right when they talk about you like a hero.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"Look at that. We'll get this scanner up and running in no time. Best you get back to Jazeen and tell him the good news. We'll take care of things here.",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_takeme_3":"You've finally arrived! Thank you!",	"npc_work_1":"Is there some problem?",	"npc_work_2":"Those spiders dead yet?",	"npc_work_3":"Those men sounded like they're in a bad way. Unless this is important I suggest you get moving.",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"",	"otherescort_3":"I appreciate you being here to help out, but I don't recognize you. If you're looking for someone I suggest you look more carefully.",	"player_1_1":"I'll take the job.",	"player_1_2":"Finally, a bit of action.",	"player_1_3":"How could I refuse? I'll go help them out.",	"player_2_1":"I'm not interested.",	"player_2_2":"No, I'm not quite ready for that.",	"player_2_3":"I'd like to help, but --",	"player_3_1":"Why should I?",	"player_3_2":"What's in it for me?",	"player_3_3":"You gonna pay me or what?",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"",	"player_4_3":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"",	"player_5_3":"",	"player_more_1_1":"",	"player_more_1_2":"",	"player_more_1_3":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_2_3":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_more_3_3":"",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want to do this anymore.",	"player_sorry_1":"No, sorry. I'll get on that right away.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"Mining outpost foreman.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"Mining outpost foreman.",	"return_waypoint_description_3":"Mining outpost foreman.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Jazeen Thumm",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Jazeen Thumm",	"return_waypoint_name_3":"Jazeen Thumm",	"waypoint_description_1":"This is the location of a survey site in need of repair parts for a mineral scanner.",	"waypoint_description_2":"A group of anglers who have recently been preying on the mining outpost.",	"waypoint_description_3":"The survivors of a survey team beset by a pack of ravenous choku.",	"waypoint_name_1":"Survey Site",	"waypoint_name_2":"Angler Lair",	"waypoint_name_3":"Survey Team Survivors",	"npc_reset_2":"It's ok.  Not everyone can put in the work I need.",	"npc_reset_3":"Fine, go on then. ",	"npc_reset_4":"I don't understand.  I thought you were better than this...",	"player_reset_1":"I can't finish this assignment.",	"player_reset_3":"I can't do this.",	"player_reset_4":"I'm tired of this job.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll get done quick as I can.",	"player_sorry_3":"This task should be finished soon.",	"player_sorry_4":"I just need a little more time..."
