		"cant_work":"If you're on the lookout for work, please come see me once your present job is completed.",	"dontknowyou_1":"I don't require any assistance, but it's very kind of you to check on me.",	"dontknowyou_2":"If you know what's good for you, you'll leave. Strangers aren't welcome here.",	"dontknowyou_3":"You weren't invited here. It would be much better if you left and didn't cause any trouble.",	"gotowork_1":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"next":"I have given you all the work I can for the moment. This project is far from finished though, so I may have further duties for you later.",	"notit_1":"",	"notit_2":"This isn't the part I asked you to get. Did you hand me the wrong item?",	"notit_3":"",	"notyet":"I don't have time to salvage and talk to you right now, okay?",	"npc_1_1":"Salvaging equipment from a destroyed ship that was once the size of a small moon is an unusual job. You'd be surprised at how many working pieces of equipment we find. If you had some time to spare, I could actually use a little help salvaging one of my workers from the wreckage. Can you help me?",	"npc_1_2":"Just the problem-solver I was hoping to see. One of my workers recently found an extremely valuable hyperdrive component but got jumped by some scavengers before she could bring it back here. She's recovering in the infirmary, but I'd really like that part back. Will you help me?",	"npc_1_3":"I'm always for living in peace with my fellow beings but I've had about enough! Commander Byrne is blaming me for all of this scavenger activity. I need to put a stop to all this thieving quickly or he's going to arrest me on conspiracy charges. Can you help me?",	"npc_2_1":"Good. Let me give you the location where that worker was assigned. Be careful out there. We occasionally have people scavenging around for things they can sell. The guards shoot them on sight so they're not likely to wait for you to introduce yourself.",	"npc_2_2":"These scavengers are really starting to become a problem. See if you can find the scavengers that ran off with that component and show them the consequences of assaulting my workers. And don't forget to bring back the hyperdrive part.",	"npc_2_3":"What would really help would be if you could find their leader and get rid of him -- or her. Once the leader is gone, the others will probably tear each other apart fighting over the division of spoils.",	"npc_3_1":"Then I must bid you farewell and attend to this matter.",	"npc_3_2":"I'd better find somebody else to look for it then. Good luck to you.",	"npc_3_3":"Did Byrne tell you not to help me? Why does he hate me so much?",	"npc_4_1":"Commander Byrne only tolerates my presence here because I do the job so well. I was hoping you might be willing to go and track down one of my missing workers before it comes to his attention. It would be a big help. How about it?",	"npc_4_2":"Certain pieces of equipment are more expensive to replace than others. This ship had the best equipment that credits could buy. Byrne will be slavering to get his hands on this piece. What do you say?",	"npc_4_3":"Ideally by ejecting Commander Byrne into a black hole -- I'm kidding, please don't tell him I said that. If you could find some of these scavengers and eliminate them, it would be a tremendous help. Will you do it?",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I don't have any more information. Was there something else? ",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Is there something you're trying to tell me?",	"npc_backtowork_3":"I have no answers for any questions you might have. I only hope you haven't changed your mind.",	"npc_breech_1":"Were you looking for me? ",	"npc_breech_2":"Maybe we can salvage something off you too. ",	"npc_breech_3":"This is what happens to intruders.",	"npc_dropoff_1":"Thanks for bringing me back. I'm glad you were there to take care of those scavengers.",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_failure_1":"Commander Byrne is going to have my head if he gets wind of this.",	"npc_failure_2":"How very disappointing. I wonder if Byrne has anything to do with all these scavengers.",	"npc_failure_3":"Byrne will never let me leave this world a free citizen. I've lost everything.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_1_3":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Give me a few minutes to find out which sector that worker was supposed to be in. I should have it around here somewhere.",	"npc_noloc_2":"I should at least get you the coordinates where my worker got jumped. That will be a good place to start looking for those scavengers. Come back in a few minutes.",	"npc_noloc_3":"I need to prepare myself in case the worst occurs. Would you mind leaving me for a few minutes? We'll begin when you return.",	"npc_reset_1":"If you wish, return to me later and complete my tasks when you feel better prepared.",	"npc_reward_1":"I'm very relieved that this has worked out so well. I hope you'll stay around for a while. ",	"npc_reward_2":"Byrne will have to cut me a little slack after this. I know he'll hate that. How wonderful.",	"npc_reward_3":"You found the leader? Oh thank you, my friend. Perhaps that will buy enough time for me to finish this job and get out of here in one piece.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"I found some really interesting pieces over here. Possibly from other kinds of ships that were caught in the explosion. Oh, I hadn't realized it was this late. Now where did I leave my caller?",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_work_1":"Perhaps I did not adequately stress the urgency in this situation. Would you please find my worker quickly?",	"npc_work_2":"Have you managed to locate those scavengers and get that hyperdrive part yet?",	"npc_work_3":"Have you found the leader of those scavengers yet? Commander Byrne isn't a patient man. He may arrest me if you don't hurry.",	"otherescort_1":"I don't require any assistance, but it's very kind of you to check on me.",	"otherescort_2":"",	"otherescort_3":"",	"player_1_1":"Yes",	"player_1_2":"Yes",	"player_1_3":"Yes",	"player_2_1":"No",	"player_2_2":"No",	"player_2_3":"No",	"player_3_1":"Could you clarify that a little?",	"player_3_2":"What's so special about this part?",	"player_3_3":"How can I help?",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"",	"player_4_3":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"",	"player_5_3":"",	"player_more_1_1":"",	"player_more_1_2":"",	"player_more_1_3":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_2_3":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_more_3_3":"",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"Escort the salvage worker back to Megan Dr'lar",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"Return the hyperdrive part to Megan Dr'lar",	"return_waypoint_description_3":"Return to Megan Dr'lar with news of your success.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Megan Dr'lar",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Megan Dr'lar",	"return_waypoint_name_3":"Megan Dr'lar",	"waypoint_description_1":"Go and find the missing slavage worker",	"waypoint_description_2":"Find the scavenger and recover the hyperdrive part",	"waypoint_description_3":"Find and eliminate the leader of these scavengers",	"waypoint_name_1":"Salvage worker's location",	"waypoint_name_2":"Scavenger thief's location",	"waypoint_name_3":"Scavenger leader's location",	"npc_reset_2":"If you wish, return to me later and complete my tasks when you feel better prepared.",	"npc_reset_3":"If you wish, return to me later and complete my tasks when you feel better prepared.",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission."
