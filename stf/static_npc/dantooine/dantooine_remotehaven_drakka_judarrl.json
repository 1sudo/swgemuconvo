But I thank you for your interest.",	"npc_1_1":"I am called Drakka Judarrl. I am a Jedi. I need your help to stop a stormtrooper squad from slaughtering dozens of natives. They've been helping me conduct raids on the Imperial garrison. Will you help?",	"npc_1_2":"The Dantari chieftain that's been helping me conduct my raids on the Imperial garrison has just had his only child kidnapped by Imperials. Could you please attempt a rescue? I could not forgive myself if this young innocent was killed.",	"npc_1_3":"The Emperor's agent here on Dantooine, a sinister figure by the name of Luthik Uwyr, has organized some of the natives into a deadly strike force. He is teaching them to use the dark side. We must stop these agents of evil before this practice spreads offworld. Can you do it?",	"npc_2_1":"You can intercept the squad at these coordinates.

I have not made any attempts to contact them for my master told me I must not let the Emperor know I exist.",	"npc_4_2":"I saw many Jedi struck down, yes. I saw the power wielded by the Emperor and his lethal weapon, Darth Vader. I wish I could wipe those memories from my mind.",	"npc_4_3":"Yes, they have a rudimentary grasp of its power but it is sufficient to make them formidable warriors. Do you still wish to tackle them?",	"npc_5_1":"He became one with the Force years ago. I was only a Padawan at the time. He saved me from the Jedi Purge.",	"npc_5_2":"We went into hiding. I was much younger then, still only a Padawan. My master helped many members of the Senate escape the Empire's persecution. It was a dark time. Darth Vader eventually caught up with my master. ",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_6_1":"I came to Dantooine when the Rebel base was first established here. I wanted to study them to understand the state of the Rebellion. I think I must reveal myself to the Empire soon. I sense our time is coming. In the meantime, I'll continue to organize strikes against the Empire with the help of the Dantari. Will you help them?",	"npc_6_2":"I was whisked away by a smuggler who had been aiding my master. Since that time, years ago, I've been careful to hide my presence. I rarely use the Force for fear of being detected by the Emperor's spies. But please, enough talk - will you help my Dantari friend?",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"You must hurry or else the Dantari will suffer greatly.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"You must hurry, friend.

I should have sent you in with more help.",	"npc_failure_2":"I must find a way to save that poor child. I thank you for your attempt.",	"npc_failure_3":"I do not wish to reveal myself prematurely but it may be time for me to take care of this menace myself.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"Yes, and I hope one day to be one as well.
