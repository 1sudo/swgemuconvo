		"cant_work":"I can use a little help with something. When you've got some free time, come back and see me.",	"dontknowyou_1":"I'm just waiting for a delivery, citizen. You can go on your way. I'll be just fine.",	"dontknowyou_2":"You don't want to be here. It's too dangerous.",	"gotowork_1":"You didn't lose the package did you? ",	"gotowork_2":"",	"next":"I can't thank you enough for the help you've given me. Come back and see me again soon, maybe I'll have more work for you.",	"notit_1":"",	"notit_2":"",	"notyet":"",	"npc_1_1":"The Empire is a rough place to be a miner. I try to look after my people but corruption runs rampant and most officials are a lot more concerned with the numbers making them look good than they are with making the numbers worth anything. Sorry, I tend to get a bit caught up. Are you looking for work by any chance? ",	"npc_1_2":"I hope you can help me. Someone trying to force me to vote against tighter safety regulations has kidnapped my subordinate. I don't want to risk my people with lax safety standards, but I don't want my assistant killed either. Would you be willing to try a rescue?",	"npc_2_1":"Deliver these reports to the commander's courier and be careful. Not everyone wants the commander to see just how much skimming goes on. ",	"npc_2_2":"I'm very grateful. All of my workers are outfitted with a locating device in case of trouble during a mining operation. This should aid you in locating the kidnappers. Be very careful, I don't want anyone getting killed who didn't start this.",	"npc_3_1":"Oh well, I'll find someone else then.",	"npc_3_2":"No matter what I do, somebody will die.",	"npc_4_1":"Commander Lytus has actually expressed an interest in finding out the truth about what goes on at this operation. I need someone to deliver these reports to his courier. He'll be pretty shocked at the discrepancy between these and the ones that were filed officially. Interested?",	"npc_4_2":"I'm not certain but I have a sneaking suspicion that the Corporate Sector Authority is involved somehow. They're a lot more concerned with credits than they are with people. Can you help me?",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Was there something you needed to say to me?",	"npc_backtowork_2":"I wish I had more for you to go on but I'm afraid that's it.",	"npc_breech_1":"Do you have a delivery for Commander Lytus?",	"npc_breech_2":"Please help me!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"Thanks for saving me from those lowlifes.",	"npc_failure_1":"I guess somebody doesn't want the truth to come out. I'm sure you tried your best.",	"npc_failure_2":"I know you tried your best. Don't feel too bad. ",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"I need to contact the commander and see where you'll be meeting his courier. Come back and see me in a little while.",	"npc_noloc_2":"Something seems to be jamming my assistant's locater device. Come back in a few minutes, I'll see if I can get someone to boost signal strength.",	"npc_reset":"Come back when you think you're ready to see this all the way through.",	"npc_reward_1":"Thanks for taking care of that. Maybe my people will get treated a little better now.",	"npc_reward_2":"I don't know how to thank you. Words are inadequate.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"I'll see that the commander gets this straight away.",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"Kelvus sent you to rescue me? What a relief, I thought I was a goner for sure.",	"npc_work_1":"Have you delivered those records yet?",	"npc_work_2":"Is everything proceeding according to plan for that rescue?",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"You don't want to be here. It's too dangerous.",	"player_1_1":"Yes",	"player_1_2":"Yes",	"player_2_1":"No",	"player_2_2":"No",	"player_3_1":"What sort of work?",	"player_3_2":"Do you know who took your assistant?",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"",	"player_more_1_1":"",	"player_more_1_2":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_reset":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"Return to Kelvus Naria and tell him you've completed your assignment.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"Escort the miner safely to Kelvus Naria ",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Kelvus Naria",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Kelvus Naria",	"waypoint_description_1":"Deliver the datadisc to the Imperial courier.",	"waypoint_description_2":"Locate and free the kidnapped miner.",	"waypoint_name_1":"Courier's location",	"waypoint_name_2":"Kidnapped miner's location",	"npc_reset_1":"Come back when you think you're ready to see this all the way through.",	"npc_rest_2":"Come back when you think you're ready to see this all the way through.",	"npc_reset_3":"Come back when you think you're ready to see this all the way through.",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission."
