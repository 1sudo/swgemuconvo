		"cant_work":"I have a certain project to discuss with you when you are less busy.",	"dontknowyou_1":"You got the wrong person.",	"dontknowyou_2":"You've got the wrong fellow. Don't make my day any worse than it already is.",	"dontknowyou_3":"Ee-you have the wrong individual.",	"gotowork_1":"Get going, he's waiting.",	"gotowork_2":"Lead me to that scientist.",	"gotowork_3":"Ee-your client is waiting!",	"next":"I have determined, to my own satisfaction, the truth of the destruction of Alderaan. I shall act on that understanding shortly. You have been very helpful.",	"notit_1":"I expected a fragment of the destroyed planet Alderaan. This isn't it.",	"notit_2":"",	"notit_3":"I expected you to bring me a recording of a transmission from the Death Star made shortly after the destruction of Alderaan. That isn't it.",	"notyet":"I can't help you... I only employ Imperial operatives. Look elsewhere for work.",	"npc_1_1":"Hello. I ask that you help me investigate a troublesome and politically sensitive subject -- to be blunt, the destruction of Alderaan. I have contracted with a certain specialist in procurement to obtain a specimen from the destroyed planet, and I ask that you bring me the sample -- discreetly. Will you do so?",	"npc_1_2":"I have received an Imperial Intelligence report that a certain space pirate is on Dantooine. I believe this pirate can tell me something useful about the destruction of Alderaan. I want you to bring the pirate here.",	"npc_1_3":"Based on a lead from that pirate you arrested for me, I have secured an alleged holorecording of the destruction of Alderaan. It may shed considerable light on my inquiry, if you will bring it here for me -- discreetly.",	"npc_2_1":"Very well. My contact has specified a rendezvous point in the wilderness. Bring the sample here, and again, tell no one.",	"npc_2_2":"Very well. Move quickly, before some over-eager footsoldier spots our subject and decides to try some target practice.",	"npc_2_3":"Very well. My contact is a Bothan informant. They seem to excel in procuring such contraband data. Please bring the recording here at once.",	"npc_3_1":"Very well. I'd prefer that you tell no one of this matter.",	"npc_3_2":"Very well. As before, I'd prefer that you tell no one about my investigation.",	"npc_3_3":"Very well. As before, I hope you will not tell anyone of this matter.",	"npc_4_1":"The official story, of course, has it that Rebels on Alderaan accidentally destroyed the planet as they prepared to use a new super-weapon against the Empire. Some evidence is troubling to that account, and that is all I wish to say at this time.",	"npc_4_2":"I believe this document considers the pirate's name classified. I can say that our subject is the last survivor of an engagement with Imperial soldiers that destroyed both sides.",	"npc_4_3":"I'm told it's a transmission sent from the Death Star shortly after the destruction of Alderaan. Apparently an Imperial maintenance supervisor aboard the battle station sent the message despite strict orders to maintain silence.",	"npc_5_1":"Possibly there is nothing to learn. However, certain world-shattering calamities could be expected to leave telltale radiation scarring, impact patterns, and a variety of more esoteric signatures. Such signs could indicate the nature of Alderaan's fate.",	"npc_5_2":"I recognize the subject's name from briefings about piracy at the Graveyard of Alderaan. Those rogues know much about the planet's destruction, though of course most of it is legend and fabulation.",	"npc_5_3":"Obviously it was a terrible tragedy in any case. Regarding the agency of the destruction I have only preliminary conclusions, and would prefer to seek more evidence before speaking my mind.",	"npc_6_1":"I believe the contact would prefer to remain anonymous. Will you bring me the sample?",	"npc_6_2":"My findings are inconsistent with Imperial Intelligence reports of the Rebellion's super-weapon. Beyond that I prefer not to speculate. Will you bring that pirate here?",	"npc_6_3":"If the Empire did in fact play a role -- but no, I am speaking prematurely. It makes no sense to borrow trouble. Please bring me the recording of the Death Star transmission -- and again, I would appreciate discretion.",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I know nothing else to say, other than what I've already explained. I ask you to bring me the sample I ordered.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"That is all I have to say. Bring me that pirate, who may shed light on the destruction of Alderaan.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"I have no more information. I'd like you to bring me that recording of the Death Star transmission promptly.",	"npc_breech_1":"Hey! Did that scientist Talmaron send you?",	"npc_breech_2":"Help! I don't care if you're with the Empire -- you've got to be better than these animals!",	"npc_breech_3":"Ee-you are from the Imperial scientist, Talmaron?",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"This scientist -- an Imperial -- looking into Alderaan? I thought all you guys were hushing it up, like that transmission sent from the Death Star telling about how it blew up the planet. I'm really surprised.",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_failure_1":"You did not bring me the sample from Alderaan? I wish I'd understood your limitations beforehand.",	"npc_failure_2":"You didn't bring me that pirate? Very well. I must find someone with greater abilities to do the job.",	"npc_failure_3":"You didn't bring that recording of the Death Star transmission? How unfortunate. I must find someone more capable.",	"npc_more_1_1":"Look, buddy -- if your scientist friend puts that hunk of rock under an analyzer, he'll see radiation signatures like nothing else in the galaxy, radiation that's specifically associated with Alderaan. So don't give me a hard time, right? Get going, he's waiting.",	"npc_more_1_2":"Alderaan? Hey, I captured so many ships there at that Graveyard -- people leaving mementos in orbit, you know -- and I heard all the stories. Yeah, I know lots about Alderaan. Lead me to that scientist, and I'll see what kind of deal I can work.",	"npc_more_1_3":"Ee-you should pay, ee-yourself, for such information -- but I shall say this: The voice is panicky, and cries much, but is clearly heard to say, \"We killed them, we killed the whole world.\" Ee-your client is waiting!",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"I am awaiting exact coordinates for the rendezvous from my contact, who is somewhat sensitive regarding Imperial observation. Contact me again shortly for the coordinates.",	"npc_noloc_2":"I have probe droids out looking for the pirate and should have coordinates soon. Contact me shortly.",	"npc_noloc_3":"I'm awaiting coordinates for a rendezvous from the informant who secured the recording. Contact me again shortly.",	"npc_reset":"Very well. I wish you'd told me of your reluctance before accepting the assignment.",	"npc_reward_1":"Very well. I shall analyze this specimen for telltale clues. I compensate you for your time, and I ask you to contact me again in the near future.",	"npc_reward_2":"If what this pirate says is true -- and I must confirm it, of course -- this opens up a new avenue of inquiry. Here -- let me compensate you for your effort, and please contact me again soon.",	"npc_reward_3":"Very well. Now let me listen to this transmission -- hmm. That is -- hmm. I must say, the evidence appears -- well, I believe I'd best keep my own counsel regarding further actions. I can't use Imperial funds to pay you this time but hopefully you'll find this a suitable reward. Again, I ask you to maintain discretion.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"I got his piece of Alderaan right here. There's plenty of 'em to go around.",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"Ee-yes, I have the transmission from the Death Star that ee-your client wanted. I expect prompt payment.",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"I'll go quietly. This has been a lousy day, so far, on a pretty lousy planet. And I think my day is about to get a lot worse.",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_work_1":"I wish you to bring me a specimen of the destroyed planet Alderaan. That isn't too difficult, I presume.",	"npc_work_2":"I'm waiting for you to bring me that pirate, who may shed light on the destruction of Alderaan.",	"npc_work_3":"I hope you'll bring me that recording of the transmission made from the Death Star. I'd like to hear it soon.",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"I'm not the one you're looking for. Don't make my day any worse than it already is.",	"otherescort_3":"",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_1":"Why are you investigating the destruction of Alderaan?",	"player_3_2":"Who is the pirate?",	"player_3_3":"What is this recording?",	"player_4_1":"What can you learn from a fragment of Alderaan?",	"player_4_2":"Why could the pirate tell you anything about the destruction of Alderaan?",	"player_4_3":"What do you think really happened to Alderaan?",	"player_5_1":"Who is this procurement specialist?",	"player_5_2":"What did you learn from the fragment of Alderaan that I brought you?",	"player_5_3":"What would you do if you thought the Empire isn't telling the truth about Alderaan?",	"player_more_1_1":"How do I know this is really a piece of Alderaan, and not some rock you just picked up?",	"player_more_1_2":"I'm working for a scientist who wants to talk to you about Alderaan's destruction? Do you know anything about it?",	"player_more_1_3":"What is on this recording?",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_2_3":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_more_3_3":"",	"player_reset":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"This Imperial scientist awaits a fragment of the destroyed world Alderaan, which he hopes to analyze.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"This Imperial scientist has ordered the arrest of a pirate who may know something about the destruction of Alderaan.",	"return_waypoint_description_3":"This Imperial scientist awaits a recording of a transmission sent from the Death Star shortly after the destruction of Alderaan.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Xaan Talmaron",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Xaan Talmaron",	"return_waypoint_name_3":"Xaan Talmaron",	"waypoint_description_1":"Imperial scientist Xaan Talmaron has contracted to obtain a specimen of the destroyed planet Alderaan from a \"procurement specialist\" at these coordinates.",	"waypoint_description_2":"Imperial scientist Xaan Talmaron wishes to have this pirate arrested, in hopes of learning about the Empire's role in the destruction of Alderaan.",	"waypoint_description_3":"Imperial scientist Xaan Talmaron has arranged with a Bothan informant to purchase a recording of a transmission sent from the Death Star shortly after the destruction of Alderaan.",	"waypoint_name_1":"Alderaan Fragment",	"waypoint_name_2":"Pirate of Alderaan",	"waypoint_name_3":"Death Star Transmission",	"npc_reset_1":"Very well. I wish you'd told me of your reluctance before accepting the assignment.",	"npc_reset_2":"Very well. I wish you'd told me of your reluctance before accepting the assignment.",	"npc_reset_3":"Very well. I wish you'd told me of your reluctance before accepting the assignment.",	"npc_reset_4":"Very well. I wish you'd told me of your reluctance before accepting the assignment.",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_reset_4":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_reset_5":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_sorry_4":"I'll keep working on the mission."
