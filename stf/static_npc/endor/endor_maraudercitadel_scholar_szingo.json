Come back later and perhaps I'll have more.",	"notit_1":"This is not the weapon my scouts described to me. Bring me that weapon!",	"notit_2":"",	"notit_3":"",	"notyet":"",	"npc_1_1":"If you have come to see me, then you have come to work. I am in need of a weapon. Our scouts encountered a group of pirates. It is likely their ship was shot down. Their leader used an interesting weapon. It disintegrated one of our warriors. Kill this pirate leader and bring me his weapon.",	"npc_1_2":"That blasted witch, Charal, raided the pirates' crashed ship. She destroyed the wreckage to insure I would not find anything else. The Marauders who carried out her orders must pay for their treachery. Find them and obliterate them. Marauders should be loyal to King Terak alone!",	"npc_1_3":"King Terak was not pleased by the deaths of his men. Unfortunately, the witch Charal used her sorcery to prove she had nothing to do with the attack. But Terak will forgive this insult if you take care of an arachne that has been attacking our outposts.",	"npc_2_1":"Good. These pirates managed to fight off several Marauder warriors. It is my hope that you have better luck. ",	"npc_2_2":"Do not worry. I will shield you from King Terak's rage once he hears that his men have been killed.

Report back to me once the spider is dead.",	"npc_3_1":"If you will not work, then you are no different from prey. Leave at once or I shall see what you taste like.",	"npc_3_2":"I grow hungrier by the minute! Leave, worthless fool!",	"npc_3_3":"I would not stay on Endor if I were you. King Terak is not a forgiving sort.",	"npc_4_1":"",	"npc_4_2":"",	"npc_4_3":"",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Why do you just stand around?",	"npc_backtowork_2":"There is no time to waste! Hurry and do my bidding!",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Hurry, before King Terak decides to take out his anger on both our hides!",	"npc_breech_1":"That's not one of our own! Blast this creature to pieces, lads!",	"npc_breech_2":"Kill that one! We will feast tonight!",	"npc_breech_3":"",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_failure_1":"Those who fail me do not live long. You are lucky I am not King Terak.",	"npc_failure_2":"How could you have let these fools escape with their lives? You are of no use to me!",	"npc_failure_3":"I shall blame you for the deaths of King Terak's warriors. Had you killed the beast of many legs this would not have been an issue.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_1_3":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"I will verify the pirates' last known location. Come back later.",	"npc_noloc_2":"I must find out where these Marauders have gone. ",	"npc_noloc_3":"King Terak wishes an audience with me. Come back later.",	"npc_reset":"Bah! Go away and do not return unless you intend to finish what you begin.",	"npc_reward_1":"You have done well. Continue to serve me well and you shall continue to be rewarded.",	"npc_reward_2":"You are an obedient servant. You serve me well.",	"npc_reward_3":"Well done. King Terak will soon forget the loss of his warriors once he hears the news of the arachne's death.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_work_1":"Where is that weapon?
