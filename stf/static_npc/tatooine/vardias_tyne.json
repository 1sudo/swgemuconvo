		"npc_1_1":"You look like you might know how to handle yourself. Maybe you really can help me. Some crazy Dim-U monks have hired a bounty hunter to capture me. They say I'm to be executed for murdering a sacred beast. Can you help me? ",	"npc_1_2":"I have a peace offering for the Dim-U monks. I hope it will get them to leave me alone. Interested in helping out again?",	"npc_2_1":"Good. I thought I was dead for sure. It's getting so you can't even protect your own property any more. The bounty hunter's name is Rhalia Jinsari. Stop her from bringing me in to those insane zealots, and I'll gladly reward you.",	"npc_2_2":"You have a good heart. It's not everybody who will stop to help someone in trouble. ",	"npc_3_1":"I understand. I wouldn't want to go up against a bounty hunter either. You'd better clear out of here before you get hurt. ",	"npc_3_2":"I guess a hotshot like you has better things to do. Thanks anyway.",	"npc_4_1":"All I did was shoot a rogue bantha that was destroying my vaporators. Those blasted monks worship banthas. I didn't do anything different from anyone else in my position.",	"npc_4_2":"I hired a talented artist to sculpt a bantha out of a piece of kiliad marble. I need you to deliver it to Brother Chonar and ask him if they're willing to forgive and forget. ",	"npc_reward_1":"You stopped her? You've saved my life! Now I just need to figure out how to calm those monks down -- before they hire someone else.",	"npc_reward_2":"You've come through for me again, and I won't forget it. I used this to harvest resources from the rivers back on Naboo. Won't be doing much of that around here though so please accept this as your reward, maybe you'll find some use for it.",	"player_1_1":"Sure, I'll stop the bounty hunter for you.",	"player_1_2":"Sure!",	"player_2_1":"Sorry, but I don't involve myself with this type of thing.",	"player_2_2":"No thanks.",	"player_3_1":"Did you really kill a sacred beast?",	"player_3_2":"What is this peace offering?",	"player_reset_1":"I can't handle someone as skilled as the Bounty Hunter.  I'll have to pass on this.",	"player_sorry_1":"Not yet, but you needn't worry.  I'll put a stop to her.",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Thank you for your help.  Let me know when I'm safe.",	"npc_reset_1":"I understand. I wouldn't want to go up against a bounty hunter either. You'd better clear out of here before you get hurt. ",	"cantwork":"I wish you weren't so busy with other things. I really need some help right now.",	"npc_work_1":"Have you been able to stop her yet?",	"npc_work_2":"Did he accept my apology?",	"npc_breech_1":"Come between me and my mark and you will share their fate!",	"npc_breech_2":"I hope this will be a worthwhile communication between us.",	"notit_2":"This will not allow us to forgive previous transgressions.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Okay, just let me know what his response is.  I hope this will appease those monks.",	"npc_reset_2":"I guess a hotshot like you has better things to do. Thanks anyway.",	"player_reset_2":"This is too valuable.  I'm afraid it will be stolen.  You'll have to do this yourself.",	"player_sorry_2":"I haven't made contact with him yet.  I'll let you know when I do.",	"dontknowyou_2":"You have nothing important to say.  I must bid you a good day.",	"npc_smuggle_2":"This gift conveys respect for the majesty of these great creatures. You may tell your employer that the Dim-U will pursue him no further.",	"next":"You know, now that those Dim-U monks aren't hunting me, my life is getting downright dull. I almost miss the thrill. Almost.",	"player_reset":"I'll have to pass on this job.",	"player_sorry":"I'll get back to work."
