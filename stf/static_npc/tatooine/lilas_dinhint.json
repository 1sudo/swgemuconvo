		"npc_1_1":"Well, well, a visitor. Hem! Welcome to my humble museum. I am the curator. If you are here regarding the recent theft of a valuable artifact, I am -- hem! -- the one -- hem! Excuse me. -- You may talk to me. Will you pursue the thief and return the artifact?",	"npc_1_2":"Ah, welcome back. Hem! You helped my little museum greatly in what I now call the Tusken Robe Incident. Might you now handle a similar -- hem! -- regrettable theft? The purloined object is a part of the armor worn by chief miner Melnea Arnthout, one of Tatooine's -- hem! -- original settlers. Will you go after it?",	"npc_1_3":"Ah, you are ready for more work? I hoped you would inquire. Hem! Now some thief has stolen a mineral scanner that dates back to the original settlement of Tatooine. It defies understanding why anyone would steal it; it lacks -- hem! -- notable historic or economic value. Can you return it safely?",	"npc_2_1":"Excellent. The stolen Tusken Raider robe has a hidden homing beacon, as is standard museum procedure. In all likelihood you will find the thief at the designated coordinates. Thank you, thank you!",	"npc_2_2":"Good. The armor, like the robe you returned earlier, has a tracking beacon that should lead you right to the thief. I speed you on your way!",	"npc_2_3":"I trust the tracking beacon hidden within the scanner will lead you to the culprit, as always. Please return the item intact.",	"npc_3_1":"I apologize for my mistake. Please enjoy your visit to my little sanctuary. Hem!",	"npc_3_2":"Not available just now? I understand. Please enjoy your visit to my little sanctuary. Hem!",	"npc_3_3":"Very well, I wish you good luck in your other endeavors. Enjoy the museum.",	"npc_4_1":"The artifact in question is a robe supposedly worn by the Tusken Raider who led the original assault on Fort Tusken centuries ago. The robe's provenance is questionable, but I know no better candidate. I would -- hem! -- very much like it back.",	"npc_4_2":"It is the endless dust of this desert. Over the decades I must have inhaled enough to fill a -- hem! -- a binary load lifter. Now, the mission?",	"npc_4_3":"It is purely a function of budget, I assure -- hem! I must requisition yet more funds for greater anti-theft protection. It is a terrible indictment of Imperial funding priorities, no? Hem! Now as to the mission?",	"npc_reward_1":"Fine work! The robe appears relatively harmed after its ordeal. These senseless thefts grow ever more frequent. I hope the Empire will grant my petition for an increased theft-control budget.",	"npc_reward_2":"The armor appears to be in acceptable condition. Thank you again for your exemplary service. I anticipate a budget increase to handle these thefts soon.",	"npc_reward_3":"This is yet another reason I am in your debt. Perhaps you will spread the word among Imperial authorities that this museum requires a greater budget to prevent theft.",	"player_1_1":"I will track down this thief for you.",	"player_1_2":"Sure, I'll go get it for you.",	"player_1_3":"I'll return it safely for you.",	"player_2_1":"No, this sounds like something for the police.",	"player_2_2":"You seem to be missing a lot of pieces here.  Maybe you should call the police, rather than asking me.  Sorry.",	"player_2_3":"No, I'm not doing another one of these repossession jobs for you.",	"player_3_1":"What is this valuable artifact?",	"player_3_2":"Why are you coughing? Are you all right?",	"player_3_3":"Why are you seeing so many thefts at your museum?",	"player_reset_1":"I'm unabe to find the thief.  I'm sorry, but I've given up on this.",	"player_sorry_1":"No, I haven't found the thief yet.  Once I do, I'll bring back the robe for you.",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I will be waiting.  Thank you for your assistance.",	"npc_reset_1":"I apologize for my mistake in asking you. Please enjoy your visit to my little sanctuary. Hem!",	"cantwork":"Welcome to the museum.  We are looking for help.  When you have full time to yourself, come see me.  Hem!",	"dontknowyou_1":"Ootini!  Din kandanii.",	"npc_work_1":"Hem!  Have you found the robe?",	"npc_work_2":"Have you been successful in retreiving the armor?",	"npc_work_3":"Has the tracking beacon been helpful in finding the scanner?",	"npc_breech_1":"Utinni! Nik maikka dinnika Dinhint!",	"npc_breech_2":"Hmm. Has that lickspittle of a curator changed his mind? I shall not cancel our arrangement. Rather, I shall cancel you.",	"npc_breech_3":"You are the fence? Late! Dinhint did say right about how much valuable is this hunk of junk, yes? Wait! You are not --!",	"notit_1":"No, no.  This is not the artifact!",	"notit_2":"The display piece that was stolen did not look like this.",	"notit_3":"This is not the scanner.  The one that was part of the museum was quite old.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Well, I hope you will be able to find it.  That was a priceless relic!",	"npc_backtowork_3":"This is good news.  All these thefts lately are looking very bad for the museum.",	"npc_reset_2":"Not available just now? I understand. Please enjoy your visit to my little sanctuary. Hem!",	"npc_reset_3":"Very well, I wish you good luck in your other endeavors. Enjoy the museum.",	"player_reset_2":"I've had something come up.  Can I look for it later?",	"player_reset_3":"I will not be able to help with this right now.  Perhaps later?",	"player_sorry_2":"I haven't managed to wrest the armor from the thief yet.",	"player_sorry_3":"Yes, it has.  I now know the location and am about to recover it.",	"dontknowyou_2":"What?  You're not working for the curator?  My mistake.",	"dontknowyou_3":"..not the person I thought you were.  Sorry about that.  If you see the fence, let him know I'm waiting, okay?",	"dontknowyou_4":"Whew!  I thought you were about to try to take this back.  Well, be careful out here in the wastes.  Good journeys.",	"notit_4":"Thank you, but this is not the piece from the display.",	"npc_1_4":"It defies belief, my friend, but -- hem! -- my museum is once again the victim of theft. I have no idea who would steal this artifact -- but the Hutts have many enemies, hem! So it is not inconceivable -- but I am maundering. Will you retrieve the artifact?",	"npc_2_4":"Splendid. You will recall, of course, that all museum artifacts have tracking beacons. It is fortunate the thieves never think to disable these! Please locate the thief and return the artifact by any means.",	"npc_3_4":"Understandable. I wish you well in your travels around our world.",	"npc_4_4":"When the Hutts first arrived on Tatooine, long ago, they held a mass slaughter and subsequent feast. The artifact is, as best we can tell, a chunk of dried meat left over from that initial feast. Will you retrieve it?",	"npc_backtowork_4":"Well, I hope you are able to soon.  The display location looks quite empty without it sitting there.",	"npc_breech_4":"I know you! Hanging around the museum, right? Tell Dinhilt this is no gemstone. You won't believe this, but -- Hey, what are you do--?",	"npc_reset_4":"Understandable. I wish you well in your travels around our world.",	"npc_reward_4":"Thank you indeed! I daresay the museum's collection would not be perceptibly harmed by the absence of this meat. But as a matter of principle, we must not tolerate artifact theft -- a point I hope the Imperial budget committee remembers when they allocate funds.",	"npc_work_4":"Wonderful!  You have the artifact in your possession, do you not?",	"player_1_4":"I've recovered all the rest you've sold -er- lost, no reason to stop now.  Sure, I'll get it back.",	"player_2_4":"I've realized what's going on here, and I don't want any part of it anymore.",	"player_3_4":"What kind of artifact is it?",	"player_reset_4":"I've been thinking long and hard, and realize I don't want to be involved in this any longer.",	"player_sorry_4":"No, not yet.  I still haven't been able to track down that dastardly bandit.",	"next":"The museum is running smoothly again. If I need more help later I'll gladly hire you again."
