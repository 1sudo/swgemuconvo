		"npc_1_1":"My name is Aaph Koden. I need the services of somebody willing to deliver a highly important message. Will you do it? ",	"npc_1_2":"I can't entrust this mission to just anybody. The Empire has discovered that Talia Reede is Force-sensitive. I need you to stop them from killing her. What do you say? ",	"npc_1_3":"Our Jedi candidate, Talia Reede, is finally coming in for training and we want to send her an escort to bring her in safely. I really need someone I can trust on this one. What do you say?",	"npc_2_1":"That's the spirit! I need you to take this datadisc to Talia Reede. It's highly important to the Alliance that she get this message. We want her to contact us, so we can see about getting her some instruction.",	"npc_2_2":"Excellent! Courageous and adaptable -- I like that. My informers tell me that an Imperial stormtrooper commander is on her trail. He must be stopped. Be very careful, he probably has troopers with him.",	"npc_2_3":"I knew I could count on you. You haven't let me down yet. Go get her, and don't let anything stand in your way. Good luck.",	"npc_3_1":"Won't even do a simple courier mission? Maybe moisture farming would be more your speed.  ",	"npc_3_2":"Lose your courage somewhere along the way, did you? Oh well.",	"npc_3_3":"I'm usually not surprised when people let me down, but I had really thought better of you.  Live and learn, I suppose.",	"npc_4_1":"We've discovered a woman we think is Force-sensitive. We want you to deliver this message to warn her of the potential dangers involved.",	"npc_4_2":"She hasn't been trained to use the Force, she just has the potential. Will you help her?",	"npc_4_3":"She's so skeptical -- it took a while to convince her she might be Force-sensitive. Can you believe it? Anyone else in the galaxy would give his right arm to be trained as a Jedi, but her we have to talk in to it.",	"npc_reward_1":"Looks like you came through for me. Good job. See me again later, and maybe I'll have more work for you.",	"npc_reward_2":"You should be very proud. You may have saved the life of a future Jedi Knight. ",	"npc_reward_3":"There are few individuals I trust as much I've come to trust you. It's an honor to serve in the Alliance with you. ",	"player_1_1":"I've done things like this before.  Sure.",	"player_1_2":"I can't stand those thugs.  Sure, I'll do it.",	"player_1_3":"You can count on me!",	"player_2_1":"No thanks, sounds too dangerous.",	"player_2_2":"Sorry, but I don't tangle with Stormtroopers.",	"player_2_3":"I'm not well-suited for this kind of thing.",	"player_3_1":"What's so important about this message?",	"player_3_2":"If she can use the Force, why can't she protect herself? ",	"player_3_3":"Why didn't she come in for training sooner?",	"player_reset_1":"I can't do this anymore.",	"player_sorry_1":"Not yet.",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Well, hurry!",	"npc_reset_1":"Won't even do a simple courier mission? Maybe moisture farming would be more your speed.  ",	"cantwork":"I'm sorry, If you're working for me, I need your complete and undivided attention. Come see me when you're not otherwise occupied.",	"dontknowyou_1":"I think I'm going to head home.  I'm seeing things.",	"npc_work_1":"Was the datadisc delivered yet?",	"npc_work_2":"Is she safe yet? Wait. Have you even left yet?",	"npc_work_3":"Talia, it's such an honor to mee...  Huh?  Where's Talia?",	"npc_breech_1":"That was weird.  Did I just see that rock fly past me? Hmmm... must've been a mirage...",	"npc_breech_2":"Help me kill this fool so we can find our target.",	"npc_breech_3":"Ummm... are you the person Aaph told me to wait for?",	"notit_1":"I thank you for offering me this, but I have nothing to give in return.  I can't accept it.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Oh, okay.  When you get rid of them, let me know.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Hm... well, Force-sensitive people can be tricky.  When you find her again, bring her back here, okay?",	"npc_reset_2":"Lose your courage somewhere along the way, did you? Oh well.",	"npc_reset_3":"I'm usually not surprised when people let me down, but I had really thought better of you.  Live and learn, I suppose.",	"player_reset_2":"No, I don't want Vader coming after me. I'm leaving this one alone.",	"player_reset_3":"I've come back to tell you I've changed my mind.  I'm not interested in this anymore.",	"player_sorry_2":"Ummm... sorry.  I -um- had to use the 'fresher.  I'm leaving right now to get her.",	"player_sorry_3":"Um, she was here just a moment ago.  Let me go see if I can find where she went.",	"npc_takeme_3":"Hello again. I guess you're here to bring me in for Jedi training. It still seems pretty farfetched to me. ",	"dontknowyou_3":"Oh, sorry.  Didn't mean to disturb you.  Have a good day.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"Me? Force-sensitive? That's pretty hard to believe. I guess I'd better check it out, though. Thanks.",	"next":"I don't have anything else for you to do at the moment. Check back with me later.",	"notyet":"I'm sorry, I only speak to Alliance...er...I've said too much already.",	"npc_failure":"I'm usually not surprised when people let me down, but I had really thought better of you.  Live and learn, I suppose."
