		"npc_1_1":"Ehh, my repair droid went crazy and dismantled itself. I need someone to take its brain to a droid engineer for analysis. You, maybe?",	"npc_1_2":"See this part? You can take it to a poor fellow who really needs to repair his vehicle, eh?",	"npc_1_3":"A friend bought this hunk of junk off some Jawas just in town for a day. Soon as their sandcrawler vanished over the horizon, the thing broke. I fixed it, so you can take it back to my friend, eh?",	"npc_2_1":"Good, good! You look for a Mon Calamari fish-woman, name of Sawoos, okay? Her, she'll want to see this brain's data.",	"npc_2_2":"Good, good. His name is Minnro Lax, he says. You just drop this off, and don't worry about what he might say or be wearing, eh?",	"npc_2_3":"Good! You look for a Bothan, her name is Trl'apra. She's maybe not feeling so good now, eh? You ignore whatever she might say. I know you had no problem with that last little job for me. This is like that, you know?",	"npc_3_1":"Heyyy, that's okay. You look around, maybe buy Watto's junk, eh?",	"npc_3_2":"That's okay. You look around, maybe buy Watto's junk, eh?",	"npc_3_3":"Heyyy, that's okay. You look around, maybe buy Watto's junk, eh?",	"npc_4_1":"This shop, it still belongs to Watto. But he retired a while back to some sunny beach on some nicer world than this. Me, I run the shop for him. Now, about that repair droid, you can help, eh?",	"npc_4_2":"I dunno, he just called. Voice only, no picture. You want this job?",	"npc_4_3":"It's a sentimental thing, maybe. You want this job or not?",	"npc_reward_1":"\"Battle plans\"? She said that? Ehh, just a running joke between us. No, can't say why stormtroopers would want a brain. Heyy, thanks! You take that droid's old head as a reward, eh?",	"npc_reward_2":"Heyyy? A Rebel, eh? Who knew? Those guards must be after him, the scum. I mean, \"the Rebel scum.\" Let's see, payment -- you want an old mouse droid, maybe?",	"npc_reward_3":"Stimpack? Heyyy, now that I think, yeah, there was a stimpack inside that junk. Jawas must have left it. I like you, my friend -- you don't ask the wrong questions. Here, want a power core for payment?",	"player_1_1":"Yeah, me.",	"player_1_2":"I am very capable of doing so.  You can trust me, Wald!",	"player_1_3":"Sure, I'll get it to him.",	"player_2_1":"No thanks.",	"player_2_2":"No.   I don't want to be know as an Assistant Junk Dealer.",	"player_2_3":"No, I'm tired of doing these for you.",	"player_3_1":"Why do you run this junk shop? Where's Watto?",	"player_3_2":"Who is the \"poor fellow\"?",	"player_3_3":"A hunk of junk? Why does your friend want it?",	"player_reset_1":"I'm sorry, but I can't do this any longer.",	"player_sorry_1":"I haven't given it to her yet.  I'm about to do so right now,",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Good.  She's waiting to repair it.",	"npc_reset_1":"Heyyy, that's okay. You look around, maybe buy Watto's junk, eh?",	"cantwork":"Heyyy, welcome to Watto's Junk Shop! You look busy, eh? You can look around if you got the time.",	"dontknowyou_1":"Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you were someone else.",	"npc_work_1":"It has been given to the Mon Calamari, eh?",	"npc_work_2":"So, did he get the part in time, hm?",	"npc_work_3":"Is she feeling better now?",	"npc_breech_1":"You wouldn't happen to be the courier, would you?",	"npc_breech_2":"Are you the one with the droid?",	"npc_breech_3":"Are you Wald's friend?",	"notit_1":"Umm... the plans aren't in this.  I was told to expect a droid brain, not this.",	"notit_2":"No, this won't work!  I need the mouse droid with the -er-... just get me the mouse droid, okay?",	"notit_3":"This won't help.  I need Wald's -um- junk he's sending.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"He's needing it soon.  Don't make him wait or it might be too late -er- for him to have junk.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Yes, she's impatient like that.  Let me know when you get it to her.",	"npc_reset_2":"That's okay. You look around, maybe buy Watto's junk, eh?",	"npc_reset_3":"Heyyy, that's okay. You look around, maybe buy Watto's junk, eh?",	"player_reset_2":"I don't trust you, Wald.  I'm no longer aiding you in your junk-giving.",	"player_reset_3":"I'm changing my mind.  I'm not doing this anymore.",	"player_sorry_2":"I don't know.  I haven't given it to him yet.",	"player_sorry_3":"I didn't know she wanted this junk that bad.  I guess I'll speed this up.",	"dontknowyou_2":"Oh, I thought you were a friend of Wald's.  Sorry.",	"dontknowyou_3":"You don't know Wald?  He's one of your friendly junk dealers.  Good guy at heart, I can tell you.",	"dontknowyou_4":"Thank you, but I can make it to the hospital on my own.",	"notit_4":"Ugh... no... this won't help... I need healing... Wald has my special medicine.",	"npc_1_4":"Okay, you understand by now -- I like to help folks who are maybe not on the Empire's party invitation list, eh? One of them, she is wounded and needs a stimpack. You can maybe bring it to her?",	"npc_2_4":"Good! Danna Lindro, that's her name. You got to get to her fast, she is trying to carry a certain report to where it will do good, you know?",	"npc_3_4":"Heyyy, that's okay. You don't mention this to anyone else though, eh?",	"npc_4_4":"Ehh, she ran into some stormtroopers. Too bad, 'cause she has plans. Important plans, if you understand, eh? What do you say?",	"npc_backtowork_4":"I know you'll get it done.  Thank you, friend.",	"npc_breech_4":"Oh... the pain....",	"npc_reset_4":"Heyyy, that's okay. You don't mention this to anyone else though, eh?",	"npc_reward_4":"Heyyy, you are my new favorite friend! You ever want discounted junk, I'll sell it to you and Watto will never know. Here, take this R4 unit. It wobbles, and maybe it kind of blows up now and then, but it's good!",	"npc_work_4":"Is she feeling all right now?",	"player_1_4":"Since you're finally honest with me, I'll be happy to help.",	"player_2_4":"What?  You're a Rebel?  No, I'm not having anything to do with you anymore.",	"player_3_4":"How did she get wounded?",	"player_reset_4":"I've changed my mind.  I don't want any part of this anymore.",	"player_sorry_4":"I haven't been able to find her yet.  I'll let you know when I do.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"Good, you're here. The battle plans are encoded in this brain? What do you mean, \"what plans?\" Oh -- nothing. Not important. Thank you.",	"npc_smuggle_2":"At last! Those stormtroopers were about to find me. You've saved my afterburners, friend!",	"npc_smuggle_3":"Lights -- too much -- uhh? For me? Oh! Stimpack! Ahh. I feel better. Thank you, I got hit with Imperial drugs and needed that antidote. But I lost the dossiers, sorry.",	"npc_smuggle_4":"Oh! Wonderful! I thought my mission was over. But now I can get these battle plans to High Command. Thank you!",	"next":"Heyyy, friend, you looking for junk? What, work? Sorry, no work for you here today!"
