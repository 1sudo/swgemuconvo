		"npc_1_1":"Actually, you might be able to help me catch the murderer. We have the murder weapon, but the fellow who owns it seems to have left town. Would you be interested in tracking him down?",	"npc_1_2":"I don't suppose you might still be feeling civic-minded? I'm a bit short-handed right now and could really use your tracking skills again. What do you say?",	"npc_1_3":"Blix Lanister's crew busted him out and left town. I have people out tracking Blix, but you seem to have a knack for finding him and his cohorts. Do you think you can find him again?",	"npc_2_1":"Glad to see you're the public-minded sort. See if you can track down this lowlife, Blix Lanister, and bring him back here to face trial. Be careful, he may have friends with him.",	"npc_2_2":"I'm glad to hear it. See if you can't find a Rodian named Gleezwuq and get the evidence back. He's the only one of Blix's gang who we don't know the location of. ",	"npc_2_3":"Lanister may not let you bring him back alive. Do what you have to do. ",	"npc_3_1":"I understand. Dangerous work like this isn't for everybody. Stay safe.",	"npc_3_2":"I wish you'd reconsider, but if that's how you want it, I understand.",	"npc_3_3":"I guess I'm on my own this time. Stay out of trouble.",	"npc_4_1":"His name's Blix Lanister. He's the sort of man you don't want to see after a late night at the cantina. He and his swooper pals have been no end of trouble.",	"npc_4_2":"Someone has stolen the blaster used on Alita Sweetwater -- the girl Blix Lanister murdered. We suspect the thief was one of Lanister's cronies. Without that evidence, we have a weaker case against him.",	"npc_4_3":"Blix Lanister's crew busted him out and left town. I have people out tracking Blix, but you seem to have a knack for finding him and his cohorts. Do you think you can find him again?",	"npc_reward_1":"You did a fine job. You should consider a career as a security officer. By the way, call me Windy.",	"npc_reward_2":"Great work! Now we can bring that scoundrel to justice.",	"npc_reward_3":"I'm sorry you had to take him down instead of bringing him back to trial, but you did what was necessary. Good work.",	"player_1_1":"I'd be glad to help.",	"player_1_2":"Sure, I'd be happy to help.",	"player_1_3":"I know his pattern.  I'm the best person for this job.",	"player_2_1":"Sorry, not my line of work.",	"player_2_2":"Sorry, not interested.",	"player_2_3":"I'm not the right kind of person for this job.  I'll pass.",	"player_3_1":"Who killed this girl?",	"player_3_2":"What's the problem now?",	"player_3_3":"How did Blix Lanister escape?",	"player_reset_1":"No, he gave me the slip.  I can't do this anymore.",	"player_sorry_1":"Not yet.  But don't worry, I'm going to pick him up right now.",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Good luck.  And be careful, too.",	"npc_reset_1":"I understand. Dangerous work like this isn't for everybody. Stay safe.",	"cantwork":"You seem a bit busy. Why don't you see me when you have more free time?",	"dontknowyou_1":"Get out of my face!",	"npc_work_1":"Do you have him in your custody?",	"npc_work_2":"Wre you able to get the evidence?",	"npc_work_3":"Were you able to bring him to justice?",	"npc_breech_1":"What do you want me for? I didn't do nothing. ",	"npc_breech_2":"You ain't taking nothing back, ever.",	"npc_breech_3":"I'm not going back there! You can't make me!",	"notit_2":"No, this won't do.  Sorry, but I'm going to need more than just this.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"While you're doing that, I'll be drawing together a case.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"We could use your kind of dedication around here, you know?  Let me know when this is all over.",	"npc_reset_2":"I wish you'd reconsider, but if that's how you want it, I understand.",	"npc_reset_3":"I guess I'm on my own this time. Stay out of trouble.",	"player_reset_2":"I'm pretty certain I'd botch this, then you wouldn't have a case.  You'll need to have someone else do it.",	"player_reset_3":"I can't find him, Windom.  I'm sorry I let you down, but I have to give up.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'm still working on finding it.  I'll bring it back when I have it.",	"player_sorry_3":"I haven't found him, but I won't rest until justice has been served.",	"npc_takeme_1":"I swear I was nowhere near the girl.  You can't prove it, either!",	"next":"Ever since you took down Blix Lanister, things have been real peaceful around here. Thanks again."
