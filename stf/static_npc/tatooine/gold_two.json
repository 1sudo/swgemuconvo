		"npc_1_1":"A couple of stormtroopers are headed this way. I really severely don't need to see them. If you dispose of them, I'm that much closer to getting out of this backwater. Except, excuse me, there's no water! Back-dump! Back-pit! Help me!",	"npc_1_2":"The hunt is intensifying. But if you destroy this one mounted trooper, you'll make it look like I'm somewhere other than here. That might divert the search. Interested?",	"npc_1_3":"I can't shake the rest of the patrol. This is the toughest bunch yet -- probably three or four troopers plus the leader. If you take them out, you'll clear the way for my mad dash to Mos Espa. What do you say?",	"npc_2_1":"Great. Get to the troopers and shoot them before they can report on my whereabouts. Watch out for sandtraps. I hate all this sand.",	"npc_2_2":"Okay, good, good. The trooper has a dewback, and the mount may make trouble too. Endless excitement in this dismal sandtrap.",	"npc_2_3":"I won't forget what you're doing for me. You're risking a lot to bail me out of a tough, tough spot. Good luck!",	"npc_3_1":"Yeah, I wouldn't look forward to facing stormtroopers either. Thanks anyway.",	"npc_3_2":"I absolutely don't blame you. Not my idea of a fun time. I expect I'll just hang back here until they find me or I slowly strangle on dust.",	"npc_3_3":"Yeah, I hear that. I feel silly just offering this deathtrap mission. But if I don't get off this barren Sarlacc-pit, I'm gonna dissolve in my own bile.",	"npc_4_1":"I'd just finished running a cargo of medical supplies through the Imperial blockade. On my way back up, they caught me. I barely survived the crash. Now I'm stuck on this dessicated rockball. Help!",	"npc_4_2":"Stressed! Yeah, you might say that. I woke up this morning and a rock-mite was eating my boots! Just one more attraction here on Tatooine, sun-drenched center for life-threatening recreation. Now, about that trooper --? ",	"npc_4_3":"The Alliance is arranging a hot new X-wing and a clear docking bay with my name on it, just as soon as I can get there. But there's this matter of the patrol to deal with first. And your choice is --?",	"npc_reward_1":"All right, all right, my life is just that much less terrible. I appreciate your help. If you want more work, I've still got trouble, so check back.",	"npc_reward_2":"Good news. Okay, it's possible I may actually pull through this. If you've got more time and want more money, check back with me.",	"npc_reward_3":"I don't believe it! I'm in the clear! You've saved me, my friend! Now I have to get to Mos Espa and jump off this despicable sand-blown crime-ridden Hutt-run krayt-loving hive of scum and villainy. Thanks!",	"player_1_1":"Calm down.  I'll help you.",	"player_1_2":"Sure, I'll lend a hand.",	"player_1_3":"I'll hold them off for you!",	"player_2_1":"I don't want to tangle with Stormtroopers.",	"player_2_2":"Stormtroopers are one thing.  A mounted one is another.  Sorry, I can't help.",	"player_2_3":"Now you're being ridiculous!  I'm not dealing with a whole squad!",	"player_3_1":"How did you crash here?",	"player_3_2":"How are you doing? You look a little stressed. ",	"player_3_3":"How are you getting offworld?",	"player_reset_1":"I'm sorry, but I've changed my mind.  I can't do this anymore.",	"player_sorry_1":"I believe there are a few left.  I'll take care of the remaining ones shortly.",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Thank you very much, my newly found friend.",	"npc_reset_1":"Yeah, I wouldn't look forward to facing stormtroopers either. Thanks anyway.",	"cantwork":"You! Can you help --? Oh. Never mind. I see you're busy. Maybe you could check back later, assuming I'm still stuck on this rock.",	"npc_work_1":"Are there any more of the stormtroopers around?",	"npc_work_2":"Was the Mounted Stormtrooper taken care of?",	"npc_work_3":"You were able to deal with them already?  Are you a Jedi?",	"npc_breech_1":"A hostile! Open fire!",	"npc_breech_2":"Halt!",	"npc_breech_3":"There's the target! Fire!",	"npc_backtowork_2":"I appreciate you helping me.  I didn't think I'd find anybody who cares on this back - ah - backwards planet!",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Oh.  Okay, well, I still thank you!  Just say the word!",	"npc_reset_2":"I absolutely don't blame you. Not my idea of a fun time. I expect I'll just hang back here until they find me or I slowly strangle on dust.",	"npc_reset_3":"Yeah, I hear that. I feel silly just offering this deathtrap mission. But if I don't get off this barren Sarlacc-pit, I'm gonna dissolve in my own bile.",	"player_reset_2":"Sorry, I've ahad a change of heart.  I don't want to get involved with this guy.",	"player_reset_3":"You know what?  I can't help you with this.  This is way to risky!",	"player_sorry_2":"Not yet.  He's approaching as we speak, so I can take care of him.",	"player_sorry_3":"Ummm... no, I'm not.  And... um... they're not all taken care of yet.  I'll let you know when to run.",	"next":"I'd hire you again but I hope to be off of this miserable desert hole really soon. Check back with me if you have time, you never know when something might foul up my plan to get out of here."
