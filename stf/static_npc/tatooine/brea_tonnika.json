		"npc_1_1":"You'd help a girl like me? Isn't that sweet. Turns out, I do need something delivered to a business associate. Well, a future business associate, I hope. Think you can handle a simple delivery?",	"npc_1_2":"I like your enthusiasm. But the task I have in mind is slightly more perilous. A dear friend of mine has fallen in with the wrong crowd and is in desperate need of rescuing. This might be a bit too dangerous for the average mercenary. You sure you want in?",	"npc_1_3":"I confess I've gotten used to you coming to my \"rescue.\" However, I just have one last little thing for you to do and then I'll let someone else enjoy your talents. I need a particular warehouse taken out. And when I say that, I mean burned to the ground. I know that sounds simply awful. Think you can do it anyway?",	"npc_2_1":"I knew this would be no problem for a tough-looking mercenary like you. Take this encrypted datadisc to Lam Bregaani, a Sullustan swoop jockey whose career I've been following closely these last few months. If he asks, tell him that everything has been taken care of.",	"npc_2_2":"I knew you were made of sterner stuff. My friend's name is Idee Zipbits. He's a Chadra-Fan swoop jockey. Not terribly brave, but pretty good in a race. If you bring him back here, I'd show an appropriate amount of gratitude.",	"npc_2_3":"I knew you'd come through for me! Now just to give you a heads-up, there might be some undesirable elements loitering around the warehouse. They're most likely cutthroats so just blast them.",	"npc_3_1":"It's not nice to feign interest in my affairs then refuse to help. Nobody likes a tease. ",	"npc_3_2":"I understand, although I am a bit disappointed. I thought there was something extraordinary about you.",	"npc_3_3":"Now you've gone and made me all pouty. I hope you enjoy toying with my emotions. Soon a girl won't know whom to trust.",	"npc_4_1":"A proposition. Of the business variety, of course. But one so compelling that I think my future partner will not be able to refuse it. Still interested?",	"npc_4_2":"I'm afraid that Lady Valarian has taken an unhealthy interest in my friend's affairs. That Whiphid is not someone you want to cross. Is it?",	"npc_4_3":"Just some speeder parts and gadgets. Perhaps an old swoop racer or two. It's an eyesore, really. I'm sure no one will be sad to see it go.",	"npc_reward_1":"I'm much obliged, citizen. Hope you didn't have too much trouble on the way. Oh, and Lam has a very vivid imagination. Kindly disregard anything he might have said. One too many crashes can addle a swoop jockey's mind.",	"npc_reward_2":"You've brought Idee back all in one piece. I knew I could count on you! Now allow a girl to show her appreciation. Take this and enjoy yourself.",	"npc_reward_3":"I gotta hand it to you, friend, you're one tough sand panther. Thanks for all your help. I think my business venture will go quite smoothly now. Take care.",	"player_1_1":"Sure, I can do it.",	"player_1_2":"Count me in!",	"player_1_3":"I'll see to it that there is only smoke and debris when I'm done.",	"player_2_1":"No thanks.",	"player_2_2":"In that case, no thank you.",	"player_2_3":"Not thanks.  Arson isn't my style.",	"player_3_1":"What would I be delivering?",	"player_3_2":"Who has your friend fallen in with?",	"player_3_3":"What's in the warehouse?",	"player_reset_1":"Sorry, but something came up.  I can't do this for you anymore.",	"player_sorry_1":"I don't know.  I haven't talked to him yet.",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Well, don't be a tease, friend. He's waiting for you as we speak.",	"npc_reset_1":"It's not nice to feign interest in my affairs then refuse to help. Nobody likes a tease. ",	"cantwork":"I'm a very demanding patron. Come back when you've less on your plate.",	"dontknowyou_1":"Who are you?  Are you some kind of promoter?  If not, get out of my face.  I've got... things to do, I guess.",	"npc_work_1":"Did Lam have anything... positive... to say?",	"npc_work_2":"Have you been able to convince Idee to come with you?",	"npc_work_3":"Have you demolished the place yet?",	"npc_breech_1":"This better not be some kind of trick.  It's not like I have anything better to do, but still.",	"npc_breech_2":"Help!  Help!",	"npc_backtowork_2":"I am hoping you will be able to do so in a much quicker fashion.  You wouldn't want to upset me, would you?",	"npc_backtowork_3":"That's why I've chosen you.  You strike me as someone who is a consumate professional.",	"npc_reset_2":"I understand, although I am a bit disappointed. I thought there was something extraordinary about you.",	"npc_reset_3":"Now you've gone and made me all pouty. I hope you enjoy toying with my emotions. Soon a girl won't know whom to trust.",	"player_reset_2":"I've changed my mind.  I don't want to do this after all.",	"player_reset_3":"Count me out.  I'm not too keen on the idea of arson.",	"player_sorry_2":"Not yet, but he'll understand in time.",	"player_sorry_3":"No, I'm still making the explosives.  This takes time.",	"npc_takeme_2":"Help! I'll do whatever the Tonnika sisters want! Just save me from these killers!",	"dontknowyou_2":"Oh, thank you!  I'll do what they say next time!",	"npc_smuggle_1":"If these bank codes are valid, then I'll be sure to \"crash\" on the second lap of the race. Make sure your boss has my transport off this rock ready to go.",	"next":"Not bad at all. I'll consider using you again in the future."
