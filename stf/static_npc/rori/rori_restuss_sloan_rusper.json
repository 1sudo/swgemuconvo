		"cant_work":"I don't wish to interrupt your current assignment, friend. Come back when your time is your own again.",	"dontknowyou_1":"",	"dontknowyou_2":"I'm a bit busy at the moment. Can't chat, sorry.",	"gotowork_1":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"next":"You've been a great help, but I think I have things under control now. Enjoy your stay in Restuss.",	"notit_1":"",	"notit_2":"",	"notyet":"I'm a bit busy at the moment...",	"npc_1_1":"How do, stranger? I'm Lord Sloan Rusper. Maybe you've heard of me? Great Naboo hunter? Well, doesn't matter. What I need is someone with a stout heart and a love of danger. Does that describe you? Feel like doing a bit of hunting? I've been given the task by His Honor, Hefsen Zindalai, to make sure this area is safe for the Arts Jubilee. Never understood all the hullabaloo about that festival, but that's neither here nor there. Care to join the ranks of the hunting elite? ",	"npc_1_2":"I'm in need of your services yet again, my brave friend. One of my hunters has gotten himself into a bit of a pickle, I'm afraid. While exploring what he thought was an abandoned tusk-cat den, he uncovered a nest of nightspiders. Fortunately, he was able to send a final distress call before communications were cut off. Can you help save the poor lad? ",	"npc_2_1":"By the Force, that's the spirit! I'll give you the coordinates of the last attack. It seems this creature tends to hunt in a small area. Have your weapon handy! Best of luck!",	"npc_2_2":"I was hoping I could rely upon you. It does this old man's heart proud to know he still has the eye for spotting a true hunter. Best of luck!",	"npc_3_1":"That's a shame. You have the appearance of someone who would laugh in the face of danger, and I'm seldom wrong about these things. I must be getting old.",	"npc_3_2":"Some people just don't have the heart of a hunter, I suppose. Ah well, sorry I bothered you.",	"npc_4_1":"Not sure, exactly. It seems something in the water is turning the predators of Rori into marauding beasts. Not that they weren't dangerous before, mind you, but this affliction turns them into nightmarish killers. And you'd be going after one of the worst in recent months. Care to tackle this monster? ",	"npc_4_2":"",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"You seem hesitant, friend. Do you wish to reconsider?",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Nightspiders creep me out too, friend. I understand if you wish to back out.",	"npc_breech_1":"",	"npc_breech_2":"Hey! Over here! Help me get rid of these spiders!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"Thanks, friend. You're one tough hunter. Can't wait to tell my friends about this.",	"npc_failure_1":"There's no telling how these sorts of things will turn out, especially when wild beasts are involved. Better luck next time.",	"npc_failure_2":"Poor boy, he was in the prime of his life. Ah well, he knew the risks of being a hunter.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"A moment, I think we've just had a new sighting. I'll get those new coordinates shortly.",	"npc_noloc_2":"Let me verify that lad's coordinates. Could you check back with me in a few moments?",	"npc_reset_1":"A shame you couldn't see this through. No matter. Come back if you have a change of heart.",	"npc_reward_1":"Bully job, friend! I knew I had you pegged for the adventurous sort. Here's something for your trouble.",	"npc_reward_2":"Stellar job, friend, simply stellar! You have a knack for this sort of work, you know. I do hope you'll continue to pursue a hunter's life.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"It's a good thing you showed when you did. I thought I was going to be feeding the next generation of nightspiders for sure. Let's get out of here.",	"npc_work_1":"Have you taken care of that slavering beast yet? We can't have our local artists being gobbled up by monsters, now can we?",	"npc_work_2":"Have you saved that poor lad from the nightspiders yet? He may not be the best hunter, but he's got a good heart. Please hurry!",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"I don't think I'm the guy you're looking for. Sorry.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_1":"What would I have to hunt?",	"player_3_2":"",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"",	"player_more_1_1":"",	"player_more_1_2":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"Bring news of the beast's demise back to Lord Rusper.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"Escort the young hunter safely back to Lord Rusper.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Lord Rusper's Location",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Lord Rusper's Location",	"waypoint_description_1":"The location of the beast's last attack.",	"waypoint_description_2":"Save the young hunter from the ravenous nightspiders.",	"waypoint_name_1":"Last Attack Location",	"waypoint_name_2":"Young Hunter's Location",	"npc_reset_2":"A shame you couldn't see this through. No matter. Come back if you have a change of heart.",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll get back to work."
