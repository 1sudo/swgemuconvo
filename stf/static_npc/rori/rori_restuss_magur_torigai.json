		"cant_work":"When you aren't so busy, you might check with me for a job.",	"dontknowyou_1":"",	"dontknowyou_2":"",	"gotowork_1":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"next":"I've received no more reports of exotic wildlife that requires control, so I'm returning to my research. Thanks for your help.",	"notit_1":"",	"notit_2":"",	"notyet":"I think I'd like to be alone with my thoughts for a while.",	"npc_1_1":"Hello. I am a zoologist studying the local wildlife -- and, unfortunately, some nonlocal wildlife. A misguided researcher imported Corellian gubburs to Rori for study. They got loose and are now breeding. Will you help me control the population by disposing of one?",	"npc_1_2":"Welcome back! I have another report of a non-native animal endangering the Rori ecosystem. It's a Talusian guf drolg, quite harmful to the ecology.  I'm hoping you can go take care of it for me.",	"npc_2_1":"I appreciate your help -- and I'll make it worth your while when you return here afterward.",	"npc_2_2":"Good. The guf drolg is eating so many other creatures, it's disrupting the local ecosystem. The faster you work, the better.",	"npc_3_1":"Very well, sorry to bother you.",	"npc_3_2":"I'm sorry. That creature is doing substantial damage to the local ecosystem.",	"npc_4_1":"It's an amphibious reptilian, squat and lazy. They capture small insects with a long tongue. They hop, which makes them difficult to target.",	"npc_4_2":"A guf drolg is a large amphibious sauroid native to Talus. It is omnivorous, ill-tempered, and generally hostile. You may need help killing the specimen.",	"npc_5_1":"Gubburs have three long whiskers they use to identify changes in weather and tectonic motion. The researcher apparently wanted to see if these creatures could predict earthquakes here. I never heard the results of the research.",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_6_1":"Gubburs are notorious for their terrible smell. They smell like burning leather, which repels most native predators. One more good reason to destroy them on Rori. Will you help?",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I don't know what else to tell you. Please find a gubbur, preferably of breeding age, and kill it.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"I don't know what else to tell you. I'd help you destroy the guf drolg, but unfortunately I'm currently occupied with my work.",	"npc_breech_1":"",	"npc_breech_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_failure_1":"You didn't destroy that Corellian gubbur? I wouldn't have thought that a steep challenge.",	"npc_failure_2":"Did you not destroy that guf drolg? Well, I can hardly blame you -- they're fierce.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Excuse me, I have to take a call from my research group leader. Please talk to me again in a moment.",	"npc_noloc_2":"Excuse me, I have to take an important call from my research project director. Talk to me again shortly, please.",	"npc_reset_1":"I understand. Tromping around the wilderness to stomp a gubbur is not my idea of a fun time either.",	"npc_reward_1":"Thank you for your help in controlling the gubbur threat to Rori's sensitive ecosystem. There is more work of this kind, unfortunately, so talk to me again soon.",	"npc_reward_2":"Thank you for disposing of that guf drolg. Thank goodness there was only one of them.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_work_1":"I hope that Corellian gubbur isn't too much of a challenge for you.",	"npc_work_2":"I hope you're preparing to destroy that Talusian guf drolg. You may need a bit of help, but I'm afraid I'm currently occupied.",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_1":"What is a gubbur?",	"player_3_2":"What is a guf drolg?",	"player_4_1":"Why did the researcher import Corellian gubburs to Rori?",	"player_4_2":"",	"player_5_1":"Why don't local predators eat the gubburs?",	"player_5_2":"",	"player_more_1_1":"",	"player_more_1_2":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"This Mon Calamari zoologist will reward you for destroying a non-native Corellian gubbur.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"This Mon Calamari zoologist will reward you for having destroyed the Talusian guf drolg.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Magur Torigai",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Magur Torigai",	"waypoint_description_1":"Zoologist Magur Torigai would like this non-native amphibian destroyed before it damages the Rori ecosystem.",	"waypoint_description_2":"Zoologist Magur Torigai would like this Talusian creature destroyed before it damages the Rori ecosystem.",	"waypoint_name_1":"Corellian Gubbur",	"waypoint_name_2":"Guf Drolg",	"npc_reset_2":"I understand. Maybe you'll change your mind later.",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission."
