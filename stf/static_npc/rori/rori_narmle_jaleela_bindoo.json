		"cant_work":"I've got some work for you when you're done with your current job.",	"dontknowyou_1":"Mesa not bein' here for yous. ",	"dontknowyou_2":"I wish I could help you, but I'm kind of lost.",	"dontknowyou_3":"I'm waiting for an important message, but I don't think you have it.",	"dontknowyou_4":"This is a bad place to be right now. You should get out of here.",	"gotowork_1":"You should be going.",	"gotowork_2":"You should be going.",	"gotowork_3":"You should be going.",	"gotowork_4":"You should be going.",	"next":"Everything is running pretty smoothly right now. I'll let you know if I need any more help.",	"notit_1":"This isn't the picture I told you to bring me.",	"notit_2":"",	"notit_3":"",	"notit_4":"",	"notyet":"I can't talk right now.  I'm too busy.",	"npc_1_1":"Hello. Are you here for the Narmle Arts Gala? A very talented artist has made a new piece for the festival and I need someone to go get it. Interested in the job?",	"npc_1_2":"I hope you still need work. One of the keynote speakers for the Arts Gala was sightseeing out in the wilderness and managed to get himself lost. Would you find him and bring him back?",	"npc_1_3":"Every year at the Arts Gala we hold an art contest to award an Imperial arts grant. They don't do that for that sad little \"jubilee\" they hold in Restuss! The judges are kept at an undisclosed location -- not even I know where. I need someone to bring these holos of the finalists and their work to an Imperial courier, who will then take it to the judges. Interested?",	"npc_1_4":"This is a public relations nightmare! The winner of our Imperial Arts Grant has been kidnapped by the runner-up, who claims that the competition was fixed. Will you please rescue Moff Graedler's nephew?",	"npc_2_1":"Wonderful! Go and meet Odoof Grunda and bring his painting back to me. I want to have it up for the opening ceremony of the Arts Gala.",	"npc_2_2":"Good. Find Jonda Trask and bring him back here in one piece. Maybe this experience will keep him from wandering off by himself again.",	"npc_2_3":"We had to arrest a few protestors who didn't make it into the final competition, so you might want to keep your eye open for dissidents who might try to stop you.",	"npc_2_4":"I'm glad you're on this. Now I know it will work out. The kidnapper fled the city, taking the Moff's nephew Zim with him. Getting Zim back safely is your highest priority. if his captor happens to die during the rescue, no one will shed any tears.",	"npc_3_1":"Suit yourself. Enjoy your stay on Rori.",	"npc_3_2":"I'm not much of an outdoors type either. I'll find someone else.",	"npc_3_3":"I guess it's not an exciting task unless you're a fan of the arts.",	"npc_3_4":"I guess we all have to draw the line somewhere. Take care of yourself.",	"npc_4_1":"Odoof Grunda is a talented Gungan artist, but he's eccentric and doesn't like cities. He painted a picture of the legendary sculptor Sidoras Bey crafting the statue of the Emperor, but he won't bring it here. Will you get it?",	"npc_4_2":"He's a well-known patron of the arts on Naboo. It would be bad for our image if our keynote speaker were eaten by a tusk-cat. Can you retrieve the poor fellow before he gets himself hurt?",	"npc_4_3":"It's the leading arts award on Rori. Well, there are the credits -- which are nothing to sneeze at -- but there's also the prestige and the exposure. Winning the Imperial Arts Grant can launch an artist's career. So will you deliver the holos?",	"npc_4_4":"Now be nice. He's a very talented young man -- and the Moff was extremely generous in supporting this festival. Will you rescue his nephew?",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_5_4":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_6_4":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Were you going to get that picture, or have you changed your mind?",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Were you going to find Jonda Trask, or should I send someone else?",	"npc_backtowork_3":"If you're going to deliver that disc, you'd better get going.",	"npc_backtowork_4":"Are you having second thoughts already?",	"npc_breech_1":"Yousa bein' here for mysa painten?",	"npc_breech_2":"Hey! Over here!",	"npc_breech_3":"Do you have the Imperial Arts Grant list?",	"npc_breech_4":"Please help me!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"Thanks for saving me from those goons. I didn't realize Rori was quite this rugged.",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"Perhaps I'll create a holo sculpture of your daring rescue.",	"npc_failure_1":"You didn't bring the painting? I was so looking forward to seeing it.",	"npc_failure_2":"If this gets out, it's going to wreak havoc with tourism. ",	"npc_failure_3":"I guess we'll have to send another message and delay the announcement.",	"npc_failure_4":"You couldn't make the rescue? Excuse me, I'm just going to go make out my will.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_1_3":"",	"npc_more_1_4":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_2_4":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_more_3_4":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Give me time to track down Odoof and find out where he wants to meet you. See me in a little while. ",	"npc_noloc_2":"Give me time to figure out his position. See me in a few minutes -- I should know by then.",	"npc_noloc_3":"The Imperial courier will contact us with the waypoint. See me in a while.",	"npc_noloc_4":"I need to clear you with the Royal Security Force before I send you in. Come back in a while and we should be ready.",	"npc_reset_1":"Very well. See me again when you think you're ready.",	"npc_reward_1":"I'm so excited to have found such a talented artist. I just wish he wasn't such a recluse.",	"npc_reward_2":"These events to promote tourism never go as smoothly as you hope. I really appreciate your help with all of this.",	"npc_reward_3":"I can't wait to hear who wins. The Imperial Arts Grant is a prestigious award.",	"npc_reward_4":"The Moff will be pleased to hear that you rescued his nephew. Well done!",	"npc_smuggle_1":"Tis bein' too crowded 'round here. Mesa no wantin' to be wit all da stinkowiff outlaunders. ",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"I'll take this to the judges immediately. Don't try to follow me -- their location is classified.",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"I'm glad to see you. I was starting to wonder if you'd gotten lost too.",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_takeme_4":"That maniac wanted to kill me just because he didn't get the grant. What a sore loser.",	"npc_work_1":"Haven't you picked up that painting yet? ",	"npc_work_2":"These events to promote tourism never go as smoothly as you hope. I really appreciate your help with all of this.",	"npc_work_3":"Haven't you made that delivery yet? The judges are waiting. ",	"npc_work_4":"You are going to go rescue him aren't you? If something happens to him because you waited, it would be just dreadful.",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"I'm kind of lost. You must be looking for somebody else.",	"otherescort_3":"",	"otherescort_4":"Who are you looking for? No, I'm sorry.
