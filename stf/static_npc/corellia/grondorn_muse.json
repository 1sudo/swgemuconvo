		"next":"I have the militia band situation under control now, thanks to you.",	"cantwork":"When you're not so busy, would you mind checking back with me?",	"npc_reset":"I'm sorry to hear that. This situation is turning into a fiasco.",	"notyet":"",	"npc_1_1":"Hello. I was out with our militia's band, the Fighting 357th Serenaders, on a training exercise. When we returned to base, I forgot my kloo horn. One of our band members went to retrieve it, but he just called to say he got lost. If you'll escort him here safely, along with my kloo horn, I'll make it worth your while.",	"npc_2_1":"Thanks. The band member's name is Vincol Dunker. He found my kloo horn, so don't let anything happen to him. That might hurt the horn. Sorry, just joking.",	"npc_3_1":"Sorry to hear that. This whole situation is rapidly becoming a fiasco.",	"npc_4_1":"Look, you try herding a pack of wayward Serenaders out in the middle of nowhere, and you'll lose track of details too. I hope if you can get the band member and my horn back safely, I won't get into trouble with my commander. Will you bring him here?",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I hope you're ready to move out and retrieve Vincol and my kloo horn.",	"npc_reward_1":"Thanks. Please accept this for your good work. Wait -- Vincol's brought that new arrangement, too. I forgot all about that! Check with me again if you want another job.",	"npc_work_1":"I need you to bring back our band member, Vincol Dunker, and my kloo horn. Are you having trouble finding him?",	"npc_noloc_1":"I got some confused coordinates from the band member, Vincol Dunker, so I'm waiting for another call from him. Check with me in a few moments.",	"npc_failure_1":"You didn't bring Vincol back? I hope he's all right. Not to mention my kloo horn, which he'd better be treating carefully.",	"otherescort_1":"I'm waiting for another party.",	"dontknowyou_1":"I haven't got anything to say to you.",	"npc_breech_1":"Are you here to bring me to Grondorn? I have his kloo horn!",	"npc_takeme_1":"I swear, that Grondorn Muse could forget his own trousers sometimes. He'll get in big trouble for that someday. Can you guide me back? I have a poor sense of direction.",	"npc_dropoff_1":"Thanks. Grondorn, here's your horn, along with a datadisc I found beside it. I guess you forgot everything but your trousers, huh?",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"gotowork_1":"",	"notit_1":"",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_3_1":"Why did you forget and leave your kloo horn behind?",	"npc_1_2":"I need your help again. I promised to deliver this arrangement of \"Corellia Ho!\" to the band leader of the Battling 166th Troubadours. Unfortunately, I have to wait here for new militia orders. Can you deliver it for me? I'll pay you.",	"npc_2_2":"Great. You want to find the Battling 166th band leader, Pytor Tuko. He's out in the wilderness on a training exercise.",	"npc_3_2":"Well, thanks for your earlier help, anyway.",	"npc_4_2":"You must know that tune -- brace up, Corellia, stand firm and tall? None shall subdue you, you'll never fall? Go your own way and let none hold you back, for your future calls you ever ever on-n-n-n-n? No? Well, it's a rouser. I hope you'll deliver my arrangement.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"I hope you'll get started soon and deliver that arrangement.",	"npc_reward_2":"Thanks. Now the Battling 166th Troubadours can hold rehearsals out there in the wilderness -- which, if you've ever heard them play, you know is probably for the best.",	"npc_work_2":"Have you delivered that arrangement of \"Corellia Ho\"? The Battling 166th is waiting.",	"npc_noloc_2":"Sorry, I'm getting a call about the new orders. Let me just take this, and then check back with me in a moment.",	"npc_failure_2":"You didn't deliver that arrangement? Oh well, I'll try to send another copy to Pytor.",	"otherescort_2":"I'm expecting someone else, actually.",	"dontknowyou_2":"I'd prefer not to get into a conversation right now.",	"npc_breech_2":"Are you bringing Muse's arrangement of \"Corellia Ho\"?",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"I wondered if I'd get this. That Grondorn -- talented, I grant you, but he couldn't remember to put his shirt on unless he got a written order.",	"gotowork_2":"I was expecting Grondorn Muse's arrangement of \"Corellia Ho.\" Don't you have it?",	"notit_2":"I was expecting Grondorn Muse's arrangement of \"Corellia Ho.\" That isn't it.",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_2":"What is \"Corellia Ho!\"",	"npc_1_3":"",	"npc_2_3":"",	"npc_3_3":"",	"npc_4_3":"",	"npc_backtowork_3":"",	"npc_reward_3":"",	"npc_work_3":"",	"npc_noloc_3":"",	"npc_failure_3":"",	"otherescort_3":"",	"dontknowyou_3":"",	"npc_breech_3":"",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"notit_3":"",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_3":"",	"npc_1_4":"",	"npc_2_4":"",	"npc_3_4":"",	"npc_4_4":"",	"npc_backtowork_4":"",	"npc_reward_4":"",	"npc_work_4":"",	"npc_noloc_4":"",	"npc_failure_4":"",	"otherescort_4":"",	"dontknowyou_4":"",	"npc_breech_4":"",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"notit_4":"",	"player_reset_4":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_4":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_4":"Yes.",	"player_2_4":"No.",	"player_3_4":"",	"npc_1_5":"",	"npc_2_5":"",	"npc_3_5":"",	"npc_4_5":"",	"npc_backtowork_5":"",	"npc_reward_5":"",	"npc_work_5":"",	"npc_noloc_5":"",	"npc_failure_5":"",	"otherescort_5":"",	"dontknowyou_5":"",	"npc_breech_5":"",	"npc_takeme_5":"",	"npc_dropoff_5":"",	"npc_smuggle_5":"",	"gotowork_5":"",	"notit_5":"",	"player_reset_5":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_5":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_5":"Yes.",	"player_2_5":"No.",	"player_3_5":"",	"npc_1_6":"",	"npc_2_6":"",	"npc_3_6":"",	"npc_4_6":"",	"npc_backtowork_6":"",	"npc_reward_6":"",	"npc_work_6":"",	"npc_noloc_6":"",	"npc_failure_6":"",	"otherescort_6":"",	"dontknowyou_6":"",	"npc_breech_6":"",	"npc_takeme_6":"",	"npc_dropoff_6":"",	"npc_smuggle_6":"",	"gotowork_6":"",	"notit_6":"",	"player_reset_6":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_6":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_6":"Yes.",	"player_2_6":"No.",	"player_3_6":"",	"npc_reset_1":"I'm sorry to hear that.
