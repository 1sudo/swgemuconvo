		"next":"I've gotten all the Bonadan Contract witnesses to safety. I don't have anything else right now, but thanks for your earlier help.",	"cantwork":"I hope you'll check back here once you're not so busy.",	"npc_reset":"All right, but don't delay once you're ready to try again. Time is running out.",	"notyet":"",	"npc_1_1":"Hello. I'm the local rep for the Corellian Shipbuilders Union. I need to send a sensitive report to a friend of mine in CorSec's fraud division, but the company -- that's the Corellian Engineering Corporation -- controls local access to the HoloNet. Will you hand-deliver it?",	"npc_2_1":"I'm glad to hear that. You're looking for CorSec officer Nola Indervin. This report has some delicate things to say about CorSec, so make sure you don't give it to any other officer except Nola.",	"npc_3_1":"I'm sorry you can't do this. Corellia needs to know what's in this report.",	"npc_4_1":"Our union has been building cargo ships that the company is selling to the planet Bonadan. I've compared the CEC productivity cost reports with outgoing product manifests, and the figures don't agree. At all. Someone high up is shaving a lot off the top. Will you deliver the report that documents the fraud?",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I hope you'll get going soon to deliver that report. It's important.",	"npc_reward_1":"I hope Nola can show that report where it will do some good. It worries me that CorSec officers attacked you. I wonder how high this scandal goes? I'm afraid we won't like the answer.",	"npc_work_1":"Have you delivered that Bonadan Contract report to Nola Indervin yet?",	"npc_noloc_1":"I arranged for Nola to pick a suitable rendezvous in the wilderness. I'm waiting to get her current coordinates. Check with me in a few moments.",	"npc_failure_1":"You didn't deliver that Bonadan Contract report to Nola? I'll have to find someone else. Thanks anyway.",	"otherescort_1":"I'm waiting for another appointment, thank you.",	"dontknowyou_1":"I haven't got time to talk now.",	"npc_breech_1":"Do you have that report from Jadam Questrel?",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_1":"I'll take this to my superiors in the fraud division. I hope they'll assign a high-clearance team to investigate.",	"gotowork_1":"I expected you to bring a report on something called the \"Bonadan Contract\" from Jadam Questrel. Don't you have it?",	"notit_1":"I expected you to bring a report on something called the \"Bonadan Contract\" from Jadam Questrel. That isn't it.",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_3_1":"What is in the report?",	"npc_1_2":"I need your help, quick! When I had you take that disc to Nola Indervin from CorSec, and then other CorSec people attacked you, that meant trouble. Now Nola just sent me a distress call, cut off in mid-sentence. Her superiors have kidnapped her to find out what she knows about the Bonadan Contract. This is my fault. I need you to rescue her!",	"npc_2_2":"Good. Nola is being held in a hideout in the wilderness. She told me the coordinates just before she got cut off. Please hurry!",	"npc_3_2":"You can't leave poor Nola to suffer out there! Please reconsider.",	"npc_4_2":"Someone high up in the Corellian government is skimming illegal profits on cargo ships sold to the planet Bonadan. Whoever that is, he must be using CorSec's fraud division as his muscle to shut down investigators -- investigators like Nola. Please help her, quickly!",	"npc_backtowork_2":"There's no more time to waste. Get out there and rescue Nola!",	"npc_reward_2":"Thanks, friend. I'll get Nola to a safe place. Sounds like she has some worries, so you might stick around if you want another job.",	"npc_work_2":"Haven't you rescued Nola from those CorSec officers? Hurry!",	"npc_noloc_2":"Nola gave me the coordinates just before she got cut off, but the last number was missing. I have a probe droid scouting around that location to find the wilderness hideout. Check with me in a moment.",	"npc_failure_2":"You couldn't rescue Nola? Oh no. What will I do now? Think, think.",	"otherescort_2":"I'm waiting for another appointment, I hope.",	"dontknowyou_2":"I haven't got time to talk now.",	"npc_breech_2":"These cops are crooks! Shoot them!",	"npc_takeme_2":"What a great, great pleasure it is to see you again. I never suspected that CorSec's fraud division could be corrupt at such high levels. I need to get back to Jadam to warn him.",	"npc_dropoff_2":"Thanks. That's another big favor I owe you. Jadam, I'm all right now, but I have something to tell you about my partner, Officer Targettal.",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"notit_2":"",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_2":"What would Nola's CorSec superiors know about the Bonadan Contract?",	"npc_1_3":"When you brought Nola Indervin here, she told me the corruption in her CorSec fraud division goes way up. Before her superiors kidnapped her, she'd told her CorSec partner, Lunce Targettal, about the Bonadan Contract. Now she's afraid the corrupt cops will go after Officer Targettal. Can you bring him here?",	"npc_2_3":"Good. Be on the alert for corrupt CorSec fraud cops. At this point they'll be marshalling their big guns to stop this investigation.",	"npc_3_3":"That's unfortunate. Well, I'll see that Officer Targettal gets to safety somehow.",	"npc_4_3":"No, CorSec as a whole is probably clean. But there could be any number of bad officers in the fraud division involved in this Bonadan mess. I hope you'll escort Officer Targettal here so we can protect him.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Officer Targettal is waiting at the rendezvous for your escort. Please bring him back before CorSec's corrupt officers find him.",	"npc_reward_3":"Thanks. We'll get Officer Targettal to a place of safety. I don't know how this Bonadan Contract scandal will play out. You may want to be cautious until the responsible parties are brought to justice.",	"npc_work_3":"You haven't escorted Officer Targettal here yet? I hope the corrupt CorSec officers haven't found him.",	"npc_noloc_3":"I'm waiting to hear from Officer Targettal with his rendezvous coordinates. Check with me in a few moments.",	"npc_failure_3":"You didn't bring Officer Targettal? I hope he's all right. At least now he's warned not to trust his fellow fraud officers in CorSec.",	"otherescort_3":"I'm waiting for a different escort.",	"dontknowyou_3":"I really haven't got time to talk, sorry.",	"npc_breech_3":"Did Jadam Questrel send you to get me?",	"npc_takeme_3":"I've been scared out of my wits after what happened to Nola Indervin. I doubt that all of CorSec is compromised, but the corruption has spread more widely in the fraud division than I would have suspected.",	"npc_dropoff_3":"Thanks for saving my skin. Now I'm going into hiding. This Bonadan Contract must involve some major players, and they'll be after all of us.",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"notit_3":"",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_3":"Do you think all of CorSec is corrupt?",	"npc_1_4":"",	"npc_2_4":"",	"npc_3_4":"",	"npc_4_4":"",	"npc_backtowork_4":"",	"npc_reward_4":"",	"npc_work_4":"",	"npc_noloc_4":"",	"npc_failure_4":"",	"otherescort_4":"",	"dontknowyou_4":"",	"npc_breech_4":"",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"notit_4":"",	"player_reset_4":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_4":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_4":"Yes.",	"player_2_4":"No.",	"player_3_4":"",	"npc_1_5":"",	"npc_2_5":"",	"npc_3_5":"",	"npc_4_5":"",	"npc_backtowork_5":"",	"npc_reward_5":"",	"npc_work_5":"",	"npc_noloc_5":"",	"npc_failure_5":"",	"otherescort_5":"",	"dontknowyou_5":"",	"npc_breech_5":"",	"npc_takeme_5":"",	"npc_dropoff_5":"",	"npc_smuggle_5":"",	"gotowork_5":"",	"notit_5":"",	"player_reset_5":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_5":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_5":"Yes.",	"player_2_5":"No.",	"player_3_5":"",	"npc_1_6":"",	"npc_2_6":"",	"npc_3_6":"",	"npc_4_6":"",	"npc_backtowork_6":"",	"npc_reward_6":"",	"npc_work_6":"",	"npc_noloc_6":"",	"npc_failure_6":"",	"otherescort_6":"",	"dontknowyou_6":"",	"npc_breech_6":"",	"npc_takeme_6":"",	"npc_dropoff_6":"",	"npc_smuggle_6":"",	"gotowork_6":"",	"notit_6":"",	"player_reset_6":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_6":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_6":"Yes.",	"player_2_6":"No.",	"player_3_6":"",	"npc_reset_1":"All right, but don't delay once you're ready to try again.

Time is running out.",	"npc_reset_4":"All right, but don't delay once you're ready to try again. Time is running out."
