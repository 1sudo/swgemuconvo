		"next":"Don't need you anymore, buddy. At least not at the moment. Check back with me later. I may have some more work.",	"cantwork":"You want work from me? Get rid of your other obligations first.",	"npc_reset":"Don't come back till you're ready to play with the big boys.",	"notyet":"I'm a busy man, pal. Talk to Grobber. If he doesn't kill you, maybe we'll have a little chat.",	"npc_1_1":"So Grobber decided not to blast you, huh? Okay, listen up. I'm in the process of consolidating some \"business interests\" here on Corellia. So far, all of my associates have gone along with the program. Some are not so smart. One of these jokers has a list of clients he refuses to share. Find this worm, remove him, and get me that list. He carries it with him at all times. Suspicious little sleemo, huh? Can you handle that?",	"npc_2_1":"Good answer. This walking corpse is a Bothan named Korowee Fa'lorn. But you can just refer to him as bantha fodder. Bring me the encrypted disc he's carrying. You can keep everything else you find on him.",	"npc_3_1":"You know I could've sworn you just said \"no.\" People who work for me don't get to say that much.",	"npc_4_1":"The kind that have access to a lot of money and some well-known peccadilloes. So you in or not? ",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I got nothing more to say about this. Is this too much for you?",	"npc_reward_1":"Nicely done. Poor Korowee probably never knew what hit him. Stick around. I could use someone like you.",	"npc_work_1":"Have you gotten me that list yet? I need those names and Korowee removed.",	"npc_noloc_1":"A suspicious sleemo like Korowee moves around a lot. We'll get a fix on him eventually.",	"npc_failure_1":"If you were trying to impress me, this isn't a good start.",	"otherescort_1":"I'm rather busy at the moment. Please do not disturb me.",	"dontknowyou_1":"I'm rather busy at the moment. Please do not disturb me.",	"npc_breech_1":"You have the look of one of Thyne's killers. You won't get the drop on me!",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_1":"Wait.. on second thought, its just some stupid names on a disk. Definately not worth dying over. Here, take the disk. Tell Thyne I said, \"Hello.\"",	"gotowork_1":"What do you want? I already gave you the disk. Can't you just leave me alone?",	"notit_1":"",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_3_1":"What kind of clients?",	"npc_1_2":"Guess what? Turns out a rival had his eyes on old Korowee's list and isn't terribly happy I got my hands on it. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's professional jealousy. Take care of this loser before he gets too steamed and goes and does something stupid like hire an assassin to try and take me out. Can you do that?",	"npc_2_2":"Careful with this guy. He's got a rather nasty reputation. Name's Wedu Belar and he's a pretty good shot too.",	"npc_3_2":"I can't stand people that waste my time. Beat it.",	"npc_4_2":"They're as common in my line of work as fleas on a bantha. Course, some of them have really short careers. You don't seem like a short timer to me. Willing to test that? ",	"npc_backtowork_2":"You getting nervous, pal? You want to back out?",	"npc_reward_2":"Where were you a couple of years ago? You could have solved a lot of problems for me. Good work.",	"npc_work_2":"Is Wedu a distant memory? What are you waiting for?",	"npc_noloc_2":"As soon as my people give me Wedu's current location, I'll pass that on to you.",	"npc_failure_2":"You let this joker live? How could you do that? Now I'll have to burn his entire house to the ground.",	"otherescort_2":"Do not disturb me. I am busy.",	"dontknowyou_2":"Do not disturb me. I am busy.",	"npc_breech_2":"I know who sent you and why. Take me out if you can.",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"notit_2":"",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_2":"You get a lot of assassins coming after you?",	"npc_1_3":"While you were out having a good time, my people came across something interesting. Wedu had been doing more than simply steaming about that little list. He'd done his homework and had collected some rather incriminating files on many of my clients. This makes them nervous, as I'm sure you can imagine. Fortunately, I know exactly where these files exist. I need you to find the guy holding them and take him out. Think you can handle that?",	"npc_2_3":"Try not to be seen, if you can help it. CorSec don't take too kindly to this kind of thing. Also, this guy, name's Wililikin, will probably not be alone, so expect a fight.",	"npc_3_3":"Really? That's a shame. And we were becoming such good friends, too. ",	"npc_4_3":"The kind that gets people sent to Dathomir or the Spice Mines of Kessel. Now can I rely on you to help me with this or do you want out?",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Gotta get this Wililikin guy before he takes action with those files. What are you waiting for, buddy?",	"npc_reward_3":"Well done. My clients will sleep easier, which means I'll sleep easier... which means I won't have to kill you while you sleep. Just kidding, buddy, I knew you wouldn't fail me.",	"npc_work_3":"I hear Wililikin's still breathing... what's the holdup? You gotta move faster, buddy.",	"npc_noloc_3":"I'll get you Wililikin's location in just a few moments.",	"npc_failure_3":"What kind of a mercenary can't destroy a petty group of thugs? You should find a new line of work, pal.",	"otherescort_3":"",	"dontknowyou_3":"",	"npc_breech_3":"Who're you? What do you want? Oh no... attack!",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"notit_3":"",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_3":"What kind of evidence?",	"npc_1_4":"It was bound to happen sooner or later. One of Wedu's partners has called in a favor and has hired an assassin to \"take care of me.\" Now I've seen what you can do and I know you're more than a match for this trained killer. Can you take of this guy? For old time's sake?",	"npc_2_4":"Good. Take this killer out so I can go back to sleeping peacefully at nights. And of course feel free to keep whatever the loser's got on him.",	"npc_3_4":"My life is in danger and you refuse to help? I think our friendship is ended.",	"npc_4_4":"He goes by the name of Drune Juntura and he operates out of Mos Eisley. You can handle this for me, right?",	"npc_backtowork_4":"I ain't getting any younger, pal. Why are you standing around?",	"npc_reward_4":"You'll make a name for yourself yet, killer, you just wait and see. I think you'll find folks around here will give you a little more respect from now on.",	"npc_work_4":"Why haven't you taken this killer out yet? We're talking about my life here!",	"npc_noloc_4":"As soon as I know where this assassin's at, I'll let you know.",	"npc_failure_4":"You mean he's still out there? He could be at my front door right now? Why did I ever bother with you? Get lost!",	"otherescort_4":"Go away.",	"dontknowyou_4":"Go away.",	"npc_breech_4":"Thyne will not escape me. You only delay the inevitable.",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"notit_4":"",	"player_reset_4":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_4":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_4":"Yes.",	"player_2_4":"No.",	"player_3_4":"Is this killer anyone I should know?",	"npc_1_5":"",	"npc_2_5":"",	"npc_3_5":"",	"npc_4_5":"",	"npc_backtowork_5":"",	"npc_reward_5":"",	"npc_work_5":"",	"npc_noloc_5":"",	"npc_failure_5":"",	"otherescort_5":"",	"dontknowyou_5":"",	"npc_breech_5":"",	"npc_takeme_5":"",	"npc_dropoff_5":"",	"npc_smuggle_5":"",	"gotowork_5":"",	"notit_5":"",	"player_reset_5":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_5":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_5":"Yes.",	"player_2_5":"No.",	"player_3_5":"",	"npc_1_6":"",	"npc_2_6":"",	"npc_3_6":"",	"npc_4_6":"",	"npc_backtowork_6":"",	"npc_reward_6":"",	"npc_work_6":"",	"npc_noloc_6":"",	"npc_failure_6":"",	"otherescort_6":"",	"dontknowyou_6":"",	"npc_breech_6":"",	"npc_takeme_6":"",	"npc_dropoff_6":"",	"npc_smuggle_6":"",	"gotowork_6":"",	"notit_6":"",	"player_reset_6":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_6":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_6":"Yes.",	"player_2_6":"No.",	"player_3_6":"",	"npc_reset_1":"Don't come back till you're ready to play with the big boys.",	"npc_reset_2":"Don't come back till you're ready to play with the big boys.",	"npc_reset_3":"Don't come back till you're ready to play with the big boys.",	"npc_reset_4":"Don't come back till you're ready to play with the big boys.",	"waypoint_description_1":"Kill the Bothan, Korowee Fa'lorn, and get the encrypted disc he carries.",	"waypoint_description_2":"Find and kill Wedu Belar.",	"waypoint_description_3":"Remove the threat Wililikin holds by eliminating Wililikin himself.",	"waypoint_description_4":"Imtercept the assassin, Drune Juntura, and stop him.",	"waypoint_name_1":"Kill Korowee Fa'lorn.",	"waypoint_name_2":"Kill Wedu Belar.",	"waypoint_name_3":"Kill Wililikin.",	"waypoint_name_4":"Kill Drune Juntura.",	"gotowork":"What do you want? I already gave you the disk. Can't you just leave me alone?"
