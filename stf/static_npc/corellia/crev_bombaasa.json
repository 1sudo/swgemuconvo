		"next":"Really, you needn't trouble yourself to wander my way any time soon. All proceeds apace.",	"cantwork":"You there. I have a likely assignment for you once you are not so busy.",	"npc_reset":"I regret your lack of will. I sincerely hope you'll resume work on my behalf at your early convenience.",	"notyet":"",	"npc_1_1":"I am Crev Bombaasa, provider of unusual services. My current clients include Shalera, known as the Lady Hutt. Yes, I thought that might capture your attention. I offer work. My informant has diligently followed an individual named Didina Lippinoss and has prepared a report of her movements. I wish you to bring me that report.",	"npc_2_1":"Your agreement pleases me. You are looking for a Bothan -- don't they always make the best informants? -- named Sli'woon Biul. Go, then.",	"npc_3_1":"I am sorry we cannot work together. I believe you overlook a significant opportunity.",	"npc_4_1":"Didina Lippinoss is the constant companion of one Karrek Flim, a name you may recognize if you peruse lists of Corellia's wealthiest people. Flim is a Corporate Sector Viceprex -- Didina does certain work that he'd prefer not to be seen doing -- really, following her makes perfect sense if one seeks incriminating information. Will you bring me the report?",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I have told you all you need to know. Go, and let me resume my work.",	"npc_reward_1":"Splendid. I can already imagine the delightful gossip this report will engender, should the worthy Viceprex fail to meet the Lady Hutt's needs. Feints, thrusts, parries -- You may go now.",	"npc_work_1":"I expected you to bring the Lippinoss dossier from the Bothan informant. You do not have it. I am displeased.",	"npc_noloc_1":"Very well. Contact me again shortly, after I arrange the coordinates for the rendezvous.",	"npc_failure_1":"I see you failed to secure that informant's report. It shows truly poor judgment to disappoint me.",	"otherescort_1":"I am not the person ee-you are looking for.",	"dontknowyou_1":"I have no reason to speak to ee-you.",	"npc_breech_1":"Ee-yes! Over here! I bring ee-you the report!",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_1":"Ee-you will wish to convey this report to Crev Bombaasa quickly. It is quite entertaining, ee-yes.",	"gotowork_1":"You should be doing something, yes?",	"notit_1":"I expected you to bring the Lippinoss dossier from the Bothan informant. This isn't it.",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_3_1":"Who is Didina Lippinoss, and why did you have her followed?",	"npc_1_2":"I have reviewed the evidence in the dossier you brought me regarding Didina Lippinoss. I find it adequate for presentation to Lippinoss herself. ",	"npc_2_2":"I'm pleased we'll be working together again. I have arranged a rendezvous in the wilderness, away from prying eyes, with Lippinoss's servant Meeko -- a Talz, one of those four-eyed folk.",	"npc_3_2":"I regret that we cannot continue working together as before. I believe you overlook a significant opportunity.",	"npc_4_2":"The dossier presents copious evidence of Lippinoss's criminal actions committed in the cause of her companion, Corporate Sector Viceprex Karrek Flim. Undoubtedly this embarrassing and incriminating data will compel Lippinoss to funnel secret CSA data to me. Therefore, it behooves you to deliver this report to her quickly. Will you?",	"npc_backtowork_2":"I have told you all you need to know. Go, and let me resume my work.",	"npc_reward_2":"Mmm. If that servant's belief is correct, Didina Lippinoss may not see reason regarding her dossier. How exasperating! I hope this will not lead to an untidy fracas.",	"npc_work_2":"I expected you to deliver that Lippinoss dossier to her Talz servant. I understand that you haven't yet made the delivery. I am displeased.",	"npc_noloc_2":"My people are even now arranging a meeting with Lippinoss's servant, a Talz named Meeko. Contact me again soon and I shall have the coordinates.",	"npc_failure_2":"You could not deliver a simple dossier to that servant? I am disappointed. Enough of you, go.",	"otherescort_2":"I am waiting for another.",	"dontknowyou_2":"I have no business with you.",	"npc_breech_2":"Were you sent by Crev Bombaasa?",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"Bombaasa was quite enigmatic about the contents of this dossier, and the need to meet at this remote location. I hope this doesn't indicate some sordid blackmail attempt. My employer will not comply, I assure you.",	"gotowork_2":"I expected you to bring some kind of dossier about my employer, Didina Lippinoss. If you don't have it, you're just wasting my time.",	"notit_2":"I expected you to bring some kind of dossier about my employer, Didina Lippinoss. This isn't it.",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_2":"What will you accomplish by showing the dossier to Didina Lippinoss?",	"npc_1_3":"It appears that Didina Lippinoss grew angry about my dossier of her criminal activities. Far from complying with my simple requests for information, she has turned the matter into an untidy fracas by hiring a bounty hunter to kill me. How tiresome. Will you please stop this bounty hunter?",	"npc_2_3":"Good. Find him at these coordinates. Report back when you're done.",	"npc_3_3":"I am sorry we cannot continue working together. You understand that if you inform anyone else of this opportunity, it will go badly for you.",	"npc_4_3":"Lippinoss has hired a bounty hunter named Mornng -- a Trandoshan. His Guild certification is current, but his career to date appears to be short. This encourages me to think that you can dispose of him with only a few of your allies as backup. Will you remove this troublesome hunter?",	"npc_backtowork_3":"I have told you all you need to know. Go, and let me resume my work.",	"npc_reward_3":"Ah, how frustrating this whole Lippinoss endeavor has been. Really, you'd think the woman would understand that her very existence is on the line. Then again, I wonder if she'd say the same about me? I expect only one of us will emerge from this alive.",	"npc_work_3":"I expected you to take care of that Trandoshan bounty hunter by now. He may be close. I am very displeased.",	"npc_noloc_3":"I have informants tracing the bounty hunter's movements. Contact me again soon, after they report his coordinates.",	"npc_failure_3":"You did not stop that bounty hunter? I am aggravated beyond description. I urge you to leave town at once, because after I finally deal with this nuisance, I may well move on to you.",	"otherescort_3":"You have no business here. Move on.",	"dontknowyou_3":"You have no business here. Move on.",	"npc_breech_3":"Hsss. My target sends someone to fight back? That always makes the job more entertaining.",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"gotowork_3":"Don't you have something to do?",	"notit_3":"",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_3":"Who is the bounty hunter?",	"npc_1_4":"",	"npc_2_4":"",	"npc_3_4":"",	"npc_4_4":"",	"npc_backtowork_4":"",	"npc_reward_4":"",	"npc_work_4":"",	"npc_noloc_4":"",	"npc_failure_4":"",	"otherescort_4":"",	"dontknowyou_4":"",	"npc_breech_4":"",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"notit_4":"",	"player_reset_4":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_4":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_4":"Yes.",	"player_2_4":"No.",	"player_3_4":"",	"npc_1_5":"",	"npc_2_5":"",	"npc_3_5":"",	"npc_4_5":"",	"npc_backtowork_5":"",	"npc_reward_5":"",	"npc_work_5":"",	"npc_noloc_5":"",	"npc_failure_5":"",	"otherescort_5":"",	"dontknowyou_5":"",	"npc_breech_5":"",	"npc_takeme_5":"",	"npc_dropoff_5":"",	"npc_smuggle_5":"",	"gotowork_5":"",	"notit_5":"",	"player_reset_5":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_5":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_5":"Yes.",	"player_2_5":"No.",	"player_3_5":"",	"npc_1_6":"",	"npc_2_6":"",	"npc_3_6":"",	"npc_4_6":"",	"npc_backtowork_6":"",	"npc_reward_6":"",	"npc_work_6":"",	"npc_noloc_6":"",	"npc_failure_6":"",	"otherescort_6":"",	"dontknowyou_6":"",	"npc_breech_6":"",	"npc_takeme_6":"",	"npc_dropoff_6":"",	"npc_smuggle_6":"",	"gotowork_6":"",	"notit_6":"",	"player_reset_6":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_6":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_6":"Yes.",	"player_2_6":"No.",	"player_3_6":"",	"npc_reset_1":"I regret your lack of will.
