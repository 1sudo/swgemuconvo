		"next":"I don't have any work for you right now. If you're looking for more work, try speaking with Karena Keer. She's usually at the cantina in Tyrena.",	"cantwork":"I can't trust you to work for me if you're already working for somebody else. ",	"npc_reset_1":"You're giving up? If you think you can handle this later come back and see me.",	"notyet":"",	"npc_1_1":"So you want to get in good with the Lady Hutt, do you? Smart move. I need someone to handle a little problem she's having. Some investigators have been looking into the Lady's shipping interests. Do you think you can do some looking of your own?",	"npc_2_1":"Good. The investigators' courier will be leaving shortly for their mobile base. Our tracer should lead you right to him. If he won't give you the report he's carrying, take it from him.",	"npc_3_1":"Afraid you're in over your head? You may be right.",	"npc_4_1":"A courier is bringing the investigators' most recent report to a mobile base they've set up. I want you to intercept this report so I can see how much they know. Interested?",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I hope you're not backing out on me.",	"npc_reward_1":"You got the report? Good work. I'll just look this over.",	"npc_work_1":"Why haven't you intercepted that report yet?",	"npc_noloc_1":"I'm having someone plant a tracer on the courier. They'll contact me once that's done. See me in a while.",	"npc_failure_1":"Blast it! I need that information.",	"otherescort_1":"I'm not who you're looking for. ",	"dontknowyou_1":"I'm on official business citizen. ",	"npc_breech_1":"Stay.. stay away, I'm an official courier!",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_1":"Here! Just take the disk, okay? I don't want any trouble!",	"gotowork_1":"Please just leave me alone. I just do this job part-time.",	"notit_1":"What is this? You were supposed to bring me the results of that investigation.",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_3_1":"What problem could I help the Lady Hutt with?",	"npc_1_2":"That evidence report you picked up was pretty thorough. Fortunately most of the investigators are being cooperative, if you take my meaning. Interested in helping me with two CorSec officers who aren't? ",	"npc_2_2":"I think the Lady Hutt is going to take a shine to you. Find these two troublesome CorSec officers and do what's necessary. ",	"npc_3_2":"It would be unfortunate if word of this job offer got out.",	"npc_4_2":"I want them removed from the equation completely. I want it to be as though the world opened up and swallowed them. I want them unable to interfere with the Lady Hutt in any fashion. Ever. Is that plain enough for you? Will you do it?",	"npc_backtowork_2":"I've said all I can. Now you need to go if you're going to do this.",	"npc_reward_2":"The Lady Hutt will be pleased when I tell her of your service. I'm impressed myself, and I don't impress easily.",	"npc_work_2":"You'd better finish this quickly. Those two could ruin everything.",	"npc_noloc_2":"Once we have their location we'll be ready. Can you see me in a while?",	"npc_failure_2":"You failed? This will complicate matters. ",	"otherescort_2":"I don't know who you're looking for, but it isn't us.",	"dontknowyou_2":"We're on official business. You just keep moving.",	"npc_breech_2":"Here comes trouble.",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"notit_2":"",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_2":"What sort of help are you looking for?",	"npc_1_3":"We've had a lucky break. An informant of ours, inside CorSec, has managed to plant a tracking device on the CorSec officer who is leading the investigation on the Lady Hutt. I think its time to bring this problem to an end. If this officer were to \"disappear\" our problems should evaporate like so much spiced tea.",	"npc_2_3":"You are becoming a valuable asset to the Lady Hutt. If you manage to pull this off, I will recommend you to her. Go now.",	"npc_3_3":"I hope you're not developing a conscience. That could make your life complicated.",	"npc_4_3":"You cut right to the heart of the matter. No lead investigator, no evidence, no case. Will you do it?",	"npc_backtowork_3":"You're not backing out on us now, are you?",	"npc_reward_3":"Thanks. If you've not already spoken with Shalera the Lady Hutt in Tyrena, now would be a good time.",	"npc_work_3":"Why are you here? I know you haven't taken care of that CorSec Officer yet. What are you waiting for?",	"npc_noloc_3":"Let me double-check the tracking frequency. Come back in a few minutes.",	"npc_failure_3":"Sometimes things don't go like you plan them. Disappointing, but it happens.",	"otherescort_3":"",	"dontknowyou_3":"",	"npc_breech_3":"So, I see the \"Lady\" Hutt has sent one of her goons, just as we expected. Now you will learn how foolish it is to interfere in CorSec affairs.",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"notit_3":"",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_3":"I take it you want me to eliminate him?",	"npc_1_4":"",	"npc_2_4":"",	"npc_3_4":"",	"npc_4_4":"",	"npc_backtowork_4":"",	"npc_reward_4":"",	"npc_work_4":"",	"npc_noloc_4":"",	"npc_failure_4":"",	"otherescort_4":"",	"dontknowyou_4":"",	"npc_breech_4":"",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"notit_4":"",	"player_reset_4":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_4":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_4":"Yes.",	"player_2_4":"No.",	"player_3_4":"",	"npc_1_5":"",	"npc_2_5":"",	"npc_3_5":"",	"npc_4_5":"",	"npc_backtowork_5":"",	"npc_reward_5":"",	"npc_work_5":"",	"npc_noloc_5":"",	"npc_failure_5":"",	"otherescort_5":"",	"dontknowyou_5":"",	"npc_breech_5":"",	"npc_takeme_5":"",	"npc_dropoff_5":"",	"npc_smuggle_5":"",	"gotowork_5":"",	"notit_5":"",	"player_reset_5":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_5":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_5":"Yes.",	"player_2_5":"No.",	"player_3_5":"",	"npc_1_6":"",	"npc_2_6":"",	"npc_3_6":"",	"npc_4_6":"",	"npc_backtowork_6":"",	"npc_reward_6":"",	"npc_work_6":"",	"npc_noloc_6":"",	"npc_failure_6":"",	"otherescort_6":"",	"dontknowyou_6":"",	"npc_breech_6":"",	"npc_takeme_6":"",	"npc_dropoff_6":"",	"npc_smuggle_6":"",	"gotowork_6":"",	"notit_6":"",	"player_reset_6":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_6":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_6":"Yes.",	"player_2_6":"No.",	"player_3_6":"",	"npc_reset_2":"You're giving up?
