Perhaps I'll send out a strike team to take care of this.",		"npc_noloc_3":"I need to track down the captain and get the exact coordinates. See me in a while and we can get started.",		"npc_work_3":"Didn't I give you a mission recently? Something about a Gungan raider hideout?",		"npc_reward_3":"Excellent work. I'm glad we don't have to worry about those raiders any more. Now Captain Vanool can land there without hurting anybody.",		"npc_backtowork_3":"Did you change your mind about taking out that raider camp?",		"npc_4_3":"If you mean, "Does he find Gungan raider camps?" -- never before, to my knowledge. But if you mean land on people -- well, not often.",		"npc_3_3":"If you're too busy, I guess you should be on your way.",		"npc_2_3":"Good for you. Be cautious in your approach. We're not sure how many raiders are left.",		"npc_1_3":"We know now why those Gungans raiders were so eager to catch Captain Vanool. One of the Gungans he landed on was their leader. Since they're raiders, we'd like you to destroy their hideout. Thanks to Captain Vanool's happy accident, we know exactly where it is. Think you're up to it?",		"player_3_2":"Why did the Gungans attack a transport?",		"player_2_2":"No.",		"player_1_2":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_2":"",		"gotowork_2":"",		"npc_smuggle_2":"",		"npc_dropoff_2":"I appreciate your getting me back to town. I'll be more careful about who I land on in the future.",		"npc_takeme_2":"Those two Gungans just won't give up. It's not as though I landed the ship on either of them.",		"npc_breech_2":"You're finally here. Yes!",		"dontknowyou_2":"I'm hiding from the Gungans. Don't tell them you've seen me.",		"otherescort_2":"I'm not the one you're looking for.",		"npc_failure_2":"These things happen sometimes.  I'm sorry if it was too rough for you.",		"npc_noloc_2":"I'm waiting for him to check back in and give us his exact coordinates. Come back and see me in a while. He should have called us by then.",		"npc_work_2":"Were you going to rescue poor captain Vanool or just leave him to the Gungans?",		"npc_reward_2":"You rescued our lost captain! Good job.",		"npc_backtowork_2":"Was there something else you needed? If not, get going.",		"npc_4_2":"Who knows why Gungans do anything they do? Perhaps the ship flew too near a sacred place on a holy day. Maybe the ship landed on a Gungan by accident. I really couldn't say.",		"npc_3_2":"I hope you're never chased by Gungans and left out on your own.",		"npc_2_2":"Great. Go to these coordinates, where he was last located. The Gungans are still after him, so you'll want to be careful.",		"npc_1_2":"Gungan raiders just attacked a transport, and the captain barely escaped with his life. Would you find Captain Vanool and escort him back to us? ",		"player_3_1":"What would I do if his permits aren't in order?",		"player_2_1":"No.",		"player_1_1":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_1":"This isn't a proper permit or credits. Try again.",		"gotowork_1":"",		"npc_smuggle_1":"Yeah, I know the drill -- you want to "check my permits." Here's your fine money. I hope somebody fines you someday. ",		"npc_dropoff_1":"",		"npc_takeme_1":"",		"npc_breech_1":"Awww, not another customs inspector.",		"dontknowyou_1":"I don't know who you're looking for, but I know you're not looking for me.",		"otherescort_1":"I don't know who you're looking for, but I know you're not looking for me.",		"npc_failure_1":"How unfortunate. I may have to handle this personally. ",		"npc_noloc_1":"I need to double-check the pilot's coordinates. Would you mind coming back in a few minutes? I should have the information by then.",		"npc_work_1":"Have you checked on that pilot yet? ",		"npc_reward_1":"His permits weren't in order? I'm shocked! And he attacked you?  Well, I guess you did what you had to do.",		"npc_backtowork_1":"Were you going to collect that fine -- I mean, check those permits?",		"npc_4_1":"Then you'd have to collect a fine. I wouldn't worry about that, though. These pilots know to keep their noses clean on Naboo -- or snouts clean, in the case of Rodians.",		"npc_3_1":"Enjoy your stay in Keren.",		"npc_2_1":"Good. He landed out in a rural area, so you'll have to meet him outside of the city. See me once you've obtained his permits or collected the fine.",		"npc_1_1":"I'm Vana Sage, second in command of security here in Keren. If you need some credits, I'm very short-handed right now. A Rodian pilot just landed, and I need someone to check his cargo permits. Interested?",		"notyet":"I'm too busy for you right now.",		"npc_reset_1":"If the job is too hard for you right now, see me later when it might be a bit easier.",		"cantwork":"You have a previous obligation. See me when you're free of other employment.",		"next":"I don't have any jobs for you right now. Check back with me later. "
