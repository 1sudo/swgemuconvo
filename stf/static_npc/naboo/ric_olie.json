		"next":"We have those pirates on the run for now, but they always seem to come back. I may need your help again one day.",	"cantwork":"I don't want to distract you from your current mission. Please see me once it's finished.",	"npc_reset_1":"If you can't handle this right now, I completely understand. Try me again after you pick up some training.",	"notyet":"I'm late for something.  Can I talk to you later?",	"npc_1_1":"I'm Captain Ric Olie. I used to be the Queen's pilot long ago, but now I track pirate activity. Are you looking for work? I'm a little short-handed at present. I know it's not terribly glamorous, but I need somebody to pick up some reports I've been expecting. How about it?",	"npc_2_1":"Good. Go and meet Jamel Luffa, a pilot friend of mine, and he'll give you what I need. Oh, and watch yourself -- my last courier vanished.",	"npc_3_1":"I'm sorry you're not interested. I could really use the help.",	"npc_4_1":"These are reports of pirate activity across Naboo. I suspect the Corporate Sector Authority is involved in this piracy, and I'm hoping these reports will give me some leads. Will you get them?",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Um -- were you going to get those reports for me?",	"npc_reward_1":"Someone tried to stop you, did they? I must be getting closer than I realized. Good work.",	"npc_work_1":"I'm still waiting on those reports. Haven't you picked them up yet?",	"npc_noloc_1":"I'll have to delay this pickup for a short time while I attend to another matter. Come see me again in a little while.",	"npc_failure_1":"You couldn't bring those reports to me? Maybe I can arrange to get another copy.",	"otherescort_1":"I'm waiting for someone else. I hope you find who you're looking for.",	"dontknowyou_1":"Sorry, friend, I'm waiting for somebody else.",	"npc_breech_1":"Did the Captain send you?",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_1":"Take this report and hurry back. I think somebody is following me.",	"gotowork_1":"",	"notit_1":"Are you sure you meant to give me this? I was expecting the pirate activity reports.",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_3_1":"What sort of reports?",	"npc_1_2":"I appreciate your help with that last bit of business. I'm actually still short-handed if you have time for more work. How about bringing me a pirate lackey? I want you to arrest a certain lowlife and bring him back to face the Queen's justice. Will you do it?",	"npc_2_2":"If I had a few more like you, I could work wonders. His name is Jutsor Delin. Bring him back alive; maybe I can get some useful information out of him.",	"npc_3_2":"I guess you're not the confrontational type. I'll find someone else to handle this.",	"npc_4_2":"This sleemo has been posing as a mining guild representative and then selling the information to his pirate cohorts. Will you bring him in?",	"npc_backtowork_2":"So were you going to do this job or did you change your mind.",	"npc_reward_2":"I'm impressed with your work. See me again later. I'm sure I can find something else for you to do.",	"npc_work_2":"You haven't arrested him yet? I wish you'd hurry.",	"npc_noloc_2":"As soon as we locate him I'll send you after him. See me in a while, and by then I'll know where he is.",	"npc_failure_2":"I guess I still need to find somebody to bring this lowlife to justice.",	"otherescort_2":"I don't know who you're looking for, but it isn't me.",	"dontknowyou_2":"I don't believe we have business to conduct.",	"npc_breech_2":"Are you looking at me? What are you looking at me for? I hope you're not looking at me.",	"npc_takeme_2":"I'm sure this is all a simple misunderstanding, but I'll go along quietly.",	"npc_dropoff_2":"This is ridiculous. I'm an honest guild representative.",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"notit_2":"",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_2":"What has he done?",	"npc_1_3":"I'm really glad to see you -- I'm in a bind. You remember my friend Jamel? Some pirates are after him, and I need someone to save him. Will you?",	"npc_2_3":"You're a lifesaver -- at least I hope you are. Please find him quickly. The longer it takes, the more likely something terrible will happen.",	"npc_3_3":"If you think you'll fail this mission, that's probably a wise decision. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to find someone who can save my friend.",	"npc_4_3":"Obviously the pirates have caught on that he's working for me. He's in grave danger. Please help him.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Are you going to save Jamel?",	"npc_reward_3":"Thank you for saving Jamel. I knew you wouldn't fail me.",	"npc_work_3":"Haven't you found Jamel yet? Hurry!",	"npc_noloc_3":"Jamel will contact us when he has a safe place to hide. See me soon and we should know where he is.",	"npc_failure_3":"You weren't able to rescue him? Poor Jamel.",	"otherescort_3":"I'm sorry, but I'm not the one you're looking for.",	"dontknowyou_3":"Don't worry about me. I'm just waiting for somebody.",	"npc_breech_3":"Hey! Over here!",	"npc_takeme_3":"Am I ever glad to see you again. Thanks for the rescue.",	"npc_dropoff_3":"Thanks again. You're a lifesaver.",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"notit_3":"",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_3":"Why are pirates trying to kill him?",	"npc_1_4":"I'm glad you're here! An emergency has come up, and you're one of the few I can count on. Those twisted pirates have hired some maniac to blow up the starport. If we don't stop him, thousands of people will die. Please help me save them.",	"npc_2_4":"My informants tell me it was a Rodian named Deelio Doln who took this assignment. Stop him. Do whatever you have to. He's extremely dangerous, so please be careful.",	"npc_3_4":"No? You won't help prevent the loss of thousands of lives? I must have greatly misjudged you.",	"npc_4_4":"They want to cripple Naboo's starfighter corps and kill many of the officials who don't play along with them. Please stop this madness.",	"npc_backtowork_4":"Are you going to stop that Rodian? Go!",	"npc_reward_4":"You've done the people on Naboo a great service and saved a lot of lives. Thank you.",	"npc_work_4":"Have you stopped him yet? Lives are at stake!",	"npc_noloc_4":"I need a few minutes to make preparations on my end. Check back soon and we'll get started.",	"npc_failure_4":"Oh, no. I hope the Royal Security Force can stop that fiend before it's too late.",	"otherescort_4":"I'm not waiting for you.",	"dontknowyou_4":"I don't know you, and I don't need to know you.",	"npc_breech_4":"Let's kill him. We can blow up the starport later.",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"notit_4":"",	"player_reset_4":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_4":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_4":"Yes.",	"player_2_4":"No.",	"player_3_4":"Why would pirates blow up a starport? ",	"npc_1_5":"",	"npc_2_5":"",	"npc_3_5":"",	"npc_4_5":"",	"npc_backtowork_5":"",	"npc_reward_5":"",	"npc_work_5":"",	"npc_noloc_5":"",	"npc_failure_5":"",	"otherescort_5":"",	"dontknowyou_5":"",	"npc_breech_5":"",	"npc_takeme_5":"",	"npc_dropoff_5":"",	"npc_smuggle_5":"",	"gotowork_5":"",	"notit_5":"",	"player_reset_5":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_5":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_5":"Yes.",	"player_2_5":"No.",	"player_3_5":"",	"npc_1_6":"",	"npc_2_6":"",	"npc_3_6":"",	"npc_4_6":"",	"npc_backtowork_6":"",	"npc_reward_6":"",	"npc_work_6":"",	"npc_noloc_6":"",	"npc_failure_6":"",	"otherescort_6":"",	"dontknowyou_6":"",	"npc_breech_6":"",	"npc_takeme_6":"",	"npc_dropoff_6":"",	"npc_smuggle_6":"",	"gotowork_6":"",	"notit_6":"",	"player_reset_6":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_6":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_6":"Yes.",	"player_2_6":"No.",	"player_3_6":"",	"npc_reset_2":"If you can't handle this right now, I completely understand.
