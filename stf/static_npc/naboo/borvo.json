		"next":"Business is running smoothly. But if I have any more difficulties, you're my first choice to solve them.",	"cantwork":"See me again when you've finished with your present employer.",	"npc_reset_1":"Sometimes unforeseen difficulties make our work harder. See me again later and try again.",	"notyet":"I lack time to talk to you at the moment. Very regrettable, I know. But please talk with my lieutenant in Keren, Bardo Klinj.",	"npc_1_1":"Welcome. I am Borvo. You needn't look so nervous. I never eat my guests -- at least not without tea, and you've just missed that. As it happens, I need some short-term help. My regular people are busy with a new project. Do you think you might be willing to deliver a message for me?",	"npc_2_1":"You have the heart of a Jedi, always willing to aid the cause of peace. Bring my message to the courier waiting outside the city. We tend to conduct these affairs away from places where people might notice.",	"npc_3_1":"Perhaps you are wise not to put yourself between rivals such as Kritus and myself.",	"npc_4_1":"A rival of mine, Kritus Morven. Recently things have been getting out of hand between us. All that bad blood is bad for business and draws unwanted attention. Will you help me arrange a sit-down?",	"npc_backtowork_1":"That's all I can tell you right now. Please proceed with the task.",	"npc_reward_1":"A thousand thanks, my friend. I have the feeling you and I shall get along very well.",	"npc_work_1":"Haven't you delivered my message yet? I'm a patient Hutt, but --",	"npc_noloc_1":"Now that I think of it, this may not be the best time to deliver such a message. See me about this again later.",	"npc_failure_1":"Regrettable that you weren't able to succeed, but these things happen.",	"otherescort_1":"You and I don't have any business to discuss.",	"dontknowyou_1":"I'm here waiting for someone.",	"npc_breech_1":"Are you here to deliver the message from Borvo?",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_1":"I'll bring this to Mr. Morven right away.",	"gotowork_1":"You didn't bring the message? ",	"notit_1":"I think you meant to give me something different.",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_3_1":"Who is getting this message?",	"npc_1_2":"I fear your previous efforts on my behalf bore little fruit. Kritus Morven lets his dislike of me cloud his judgment. Speaking of my illustrious competitor, you might assist me in teaching him a lesson. He's been crossing the line recently, and I want to discourage his childish antics.",	"npc_2_2":"Ah, so like myself -- willing to negotiate but unafraid of conflict. Kritus recently shipped a valuable commodity to Naboo that he is temporarily storing at one of his smuggling dens. I want you to destroy the building, contents and all.",	"npc_3_2":"Truly your years belie your wisdom. It would indeed be foolish to get caught up in our struggle.",	"npc_4_2":"Petty things, really. Like telling Naboo Security the location of some of my hidden installations. Will you discourage such escapades on my behalf?",	"npc_backtowork_2":"You know all that you require. Go destroy that building. ",	"npc_reward_2":"Excellent. Once again you have my gratitude.",	"npc_work_2":"Why haven't you destroyed that building yet?",	"npc_noloc_2":"Perhaps we should wait a bit on that destruction. I have just received news that may alter the social landscape. Meet with me later.",	"npc_failure_2":"What a pity. I thought you'd be able to handle that. Very regrettable.",	"otherescort_2":"",	"dontknowyou_2":"",	"npc_breech_2":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"notit_2":"",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_2":"What sort of childish antics?",	"npc_1_3":"I have need of you once more, my friend. One of my employees, a scientist, is out getting samples for a business venture, but she needs an escort to get back safely. Will you help me?",	"npc_2_3":"I knew I could count on you. Her work is very important to me, so please bring her back safely. I'm sure she's completely unnerved out there in the wilderness.",	"npc_3_3":"I admire your sense of self-preservation. It's dangerous out in the wilderness.",	"npc_4_3":"She actually had an escort when she left -- I'm not sure what happened to him. She's a scientist and not used to defending herself. Will you bring her back?",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Please hurry and bring back my scientist. ",	"npc_reward_3":"Where others would fail, you succeed. Well done.",	"npc_work_3":"You mean she's still waiting out in the wilderness? Well, go get her!",	"npc_noloc_3":"It occurs to me -- this could be a valuable lesson to teach her not to lose her escort. I think I'll have you bring her back later. ",	"npc_failure_3":"You failed me? Words can not express my surprise and regret. I'm sure you won't let it happen again.",	"otherescort_3":"Sorry, I'm waiting for somebody else. ",	"dontknowyou_3":"I'm busy right now and don't have time to talk.",	"npc_breech_3":"Did Borvo send you?",	"npc_takeme_3":"I'm so glad you're here. My previous escort was killed by a narglatch.",	"npc_dropoff_3":"Thanks for getting me here. I never could have made it by myself.",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"notit_3":"",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_3":"Why does she need an escort?",	"npc_1_4":"My friend, I need your help in a delicate matter involving my business. One of my lieutenants thinks that because he works for me, he can do anything he wishes. He's been drawing unwanted attention to my organization. Can you help me deal with him?",	"npc_2_4":"Deal with him as you think best, of course. I've learned to trust your judgment. I warn you, though -- he's very full of himself and may not be willing to listen to reason.",	"npc_3_4":"Once again your wisdom astounds me. You're right, this is a family matter, and I should attend to it myself.",	"npc_4_4":"Demanding money from merchants. Shooting people who annoy him, and then warning witnesses \"who his boss is\" and how \"they'd better keep quiet.\" Killing the security officer who was investigating his case. Things like that. All very regrettable. Will you help me?",	"npc_backtowork_4":"I really need you to attend to this matter with all speed.",	"npc_reward_4":"That's one way to keep someone from misbehaving. You should have been born a Hutt.",	"npc_work_4":"Haven't you yet shown my lieutenant the error of his ways?",	"npc_noloc_4":"Actually, I'm not sure where he is right now. See me later, and with luck I'll have the coordinates you need.",	"npc_failure_4":"I was so sure you could make him behave. How regrettable.",	"otherescort_4":"I know you're not here to see me.",	"dontknowyou_4":"What are you bothering me for? Get a job.",	"npc_breech_4":"I work for Borvo the Hutt, you fool! You can't touch me!",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"notit_4":"",	"player_reset_4":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_4":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_4":"Yes.",	"player_2_4":"No.",	"player_3_4":"How has he been drawing attention to you?",	"npc_1_5":"This business never gets dull. A pilot known to be friendly to the Alliance has managed to get in trouble with Naboo security instead of the Imperials. I'm being paid to smuggle him off-planet. Will you bring him to me?",	"npc_2_5":"Your loyalty is an inspiration to all who know you. The pilot's name is Naz Tulos. Bring him to me before Royal Security catches up with him.",	"npc_3_5":"Very prudent of you not to meddle in Rebel affairs. The Empire is not well disposed toward that sort of behavior. ",	"npc_4_5":"Let's just say he rashly assumed that a Naboo Royal Security Forces ship belonged to the Empire. At the time, he was doing something the Imperials wouldn't like, and so he took action. Very regrettable. Will you bring him to me?",	"npc_backtowork_5":"Hurry up and bring him to me, or neither of us will make any credits off this situation.",	"npc_reward_5":"I admire your resourcefulness. You've done very well.",	"npc_work_5":"If you don't find him soon, the Royal Security Forces will.",	"npc_noloc_5":"Actually, things are a little hot for him right now. I'll send you to find him when things have cooled down a little.",	"npc_failure_5":"I do so hate to lose an opportunity to make credits. Oh well, no use worrying about what we can't change.",	"otherescort_5":"I don't know who your looking for, but I do know it isn't me.",	"dontknowyou_5":"I'm afraid I don't have time for idle chitchat. ",	"npc_breech_5":"Did the Hutt send you to find somebody?",	"npc_takeme_5":"Royal Security, Imperial Security. How am I supposed to keep track of all these details? Just help get me off this world.",	"npc_dropoff_5":"Thanks for getting me here.",	"npc_smuggle_5":"",	"gotowork_5":"",	"notit_5":"",	"player_reset_5":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_5":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_5":"Yes.",	"player_2_5":"No.",	"player_3_5":"How did he get in trouble with the Royal Security Forces?",	"npc_1_6":"Do you know much about the Berserker Virus? It's an ailment that has recently been infecting the creatures of Naboo. It makes them unusually aggressive. I'm selling a sample of the virus to a buyer from Corellia. You've been very dependable so far. Will you deliver the sample?",	"npc_2_6":"Fine, fine. Kritus Morven is very keen to get in on this operation, so be careful that he doesn't foul up this delivery. I don't want anything to upset my buyer.",	"npc_3_6":"I completely understand. I too am wary of handling this sort of biohazard.",	"npc_4_6":"We've not yet managed to engineer a strain that works on sapient creatures, so you should be completely safe. Will you do it?",	"npc_backtowork_6":"I can't tell you anything more. Please -- just make the delivery.",	"npc_reward_6":"You're everything a Hutt could want in an employee. ",	"npc_work_6":"You haven't delivered it yet? My buyer is waiting.",	"npc_noloc_6":"They haven't paid me, so I don't want it delivered quite yet. Come back and see me later.",	"npc_failure_6":"Very regrettable. My Corellian business associates will not be happy about this. ",	"otherescort_6":"I'm waiting for somebody else. ",	"dontknowyou_6":"Sorry, I can't talk right now.",	"npc_breech_6":"Hey! Are you the courier from Borvo?",	"npc_takeme_6":"",	"npc_dropoff_6":"",	"npc_smuggle_6":"That's what I've been waiting for. Take care.",	"gotowork_6":"Where's my package?",	"notit_6":"What's that? You were supposed to give me something different.",	"player_reset_6":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_6":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_6":"Yes.",	"player_2_6":"No.",	"player_3_6":"Is it safe for me to handle this virus?",	"npc_reset_2":"Sometimes unforeseen difficulties make our work harder. See me again later and try again.",	"npc_reset_3":"Sometimes unforeseen difficulties make our work harder. See me again later and try again.",	"npc_reset_4":"Sometimes unforeseen difficulties make our work harder. See me again later and try again.",	"npc_reset_5":"Sometimes unforeseen difficulties make our work harder. See me again later and try again.",	"npc_reset_6":"Sometimes unforeseen difficulties make our work harder. See me again later and try again."
