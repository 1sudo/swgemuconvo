		"next":"Nice to see you again, but I don't need your help right now. Have you made it to Dee'ja Peak to talk to Pooja Naberrie? I hope so.",	"cantwork":"Hello. I'll want to talk to you when you're less busy. Good luck on your current assignment.",	"npc_reset_1":"All right, I understand. When you're ready to work with us, I hope you'll return.",	"notyet":"This palace operates by the chain of command. If you're looking for work, talk to Lieutenant Porro Dolphe. If no one else sent you to see me, then I have nothing to offer you.",	"npc_1_1":"I see you bear Her Majesty's token, a sign of rare trust. I'll be brief: Some on Naboo are working secretly to restore the Republic. Maybe you know that High Inquisitor Mal Sikander doesn't like Naboo's governor, Ian Lago. Sikander plans to undermine Lago by uncovering purported \"unrest\" on Naboo. He's sent an agent provocateur to wipe out a group of Lago's supporters. We want you to stop the agent.",	"npc_2_1":"All right. The agent is a bounty hunter named Argo Murr. He's headed this way from his landing point in the wilderness. Move fast to stop him, and be careful -- he's dangerous.",	"npc_3_1":"With the Queen's trust in you, I expected better. Well, that's all for now.",	"npc_4_1":"Here on Naboo we've never liked murder. But if you want cold pragmatism, look at it this way: If the Empire thinks the Alliance is a real danger here, they'll crack down on us even harder. Now, is that enough of a reason for you to stop these pointless deaths?",	"npc_backtowork_1":"You should get to work now. A lot is riding on you.",	"npc_reward_1":"That was good work. Her Majesty was wise to trust you. There's more work to be done, too, so check back with me.",	"npc_work_1":"You should be at work. A lot is riding on you.",	"npc_noloc_1":"All right. The bounty hunter is heading here from -- hmm -- I don't seem to have his coordinates yet. Check with me later.",	"npc_failure_1":"You couldn't stop the bounty hunter? Well, no shame in that -- he was a tough customer.",	"otherescort_1":"I don't know you. Clear out, or you'll be in trouble.",	"dontknowyou_1":"I don't know you. Clear out, or you'll be in trouble.",	"npc_breech_1":"You want me to \"go along quietly\"? I don't think so.",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"gotowork_1":"",	"notit_1":"",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_3_1":"Why should you care if Lago's allies are killed? That helps you, doesn't it?",	"npc_1_2":"I'm glad you're still interested in helping us. I have an urgent mission that calls for a very capable agent. RSF intelligence has discovered that the Empire is stockpiling nerve agents as crowd control weapons. They're responding to Mal Sikander's reports of supposed \"unrest.\" There's enough gas there to wipe out all of Theed. I need you to destroy the warehouse.",	"npc_2_2":"All right, I expect this will be tough, so put together a good team. Report back here when you've completed the mission. Good luck!",	"npc_3_2":"With the fate of a city in the balance, I can't believe you'd walk away from this one. I hope you'll reconsider soon.",	"npc_4_2":"Good question. Imperial nerve agents are stored as inert components that don't become toxic until they're combined. You can blow the warehouse sky-high without fear of gassing the countryside. Will you take the mission?",	"npc_backtowork_2":"You should get to work now. A lot is riding on you.",	"npc_reward_2":"Great job! I have more work for you when you want it. For now, take this reward and have a well-earned rest.",	"npc_work_2":"You should be at work. A lot is riding on you.",	"npc_noloc_2":"All right. The nerve agent warehouse is located at -- hmm -- I don't seem to have its coordinates. Check with me later.",	"npc_failure_2":"You didn't take out the warehouse? Well, it was heavily guarded. We'll just have to field a larger team in our next attack.",	"otherescort_2":"",	"dontknowyou_2":"",	"npc_breech_2":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"notit_2":"",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_3_2":"Why do you want a warehouse full of nerve gas blown up? Isn't that unsafe?",	"npc_1_3":"I'm glad you checked in. We have a sudden crisis, and we need a top team to handle it. Mal Sikander has falsely accused an RSF officer of leading the assault on the Imperial nerve agent warehouse. He's sent a strike team of stormtroopers to kill the officer, who has fled to the wilderness. Bring back the officer so we can keep him safely hidden beneath the palace.",	"npc_2_3":"Good. I expect you're facing four or five troopers, and probably a squad leader. So get some help, and some heavy firepower. Good luck!",	"npc_3_3":"Blast. I don't know what we'll do now. Poor Meiro -- he doesn't deserve what will happen to him. Let me know if you reconsider.",	"npc_4_3":"His name is Meiro Wellightner -- one of my lieutenants, maybe a bit too outspoken against the Empire. In the RSF you can sometimes survive that, but Mal Sikander has decided to make an example of Meiro. Will you rescue him?",	"npc_backtowork_3":"You should get to work now. A lot is riding on you.",	"npc_reward_3":"That was remarkable. I'll mention your good work to some people I know. Meanwhile, take this reward, and check back when you want another assignment.",	"npc_work_3":"You should be at work. A lot is riding on you.",	"npc_noloc_3":"All right. Wellightner is being held at -- hmm -- I don't seem to have his coordinates. Check with me soon.",	"npc_failure_3":"You couldn't free Wellightner? That was my fault -- I hadn't realized he was so heavily guarded. We'll use a bigger team in our next assault.",	"otherescort_3":"I really, really can't talk to you right now.",	"dontknowyou_3":"I really, really can't talk to you right now.",	"npc_breech_3":"Watch out for the stormtroopers! Take out the leader first!",	"npc_takeme_3":"Am I glad to see you! Those goons were ready to kill me. I should never have made fun of the Emperor's nose in the mess-hall.",	"npc_dropoff_3":"That was quite an adventure. It's like that every day around here. Thanks!",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"notit_3":"",	"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_3_3":"Who is the officer?",	"npc_1_4":"Alliance leaders on Naboo have noted your good work, and they're asking your help in a major new plan. We've planted evidence to make Mal Sikander think that his rival, Governor Ian Lago, secretly ordered the destruction of that nerve gas warehouse. Sikander's storm commandos have retrieved our planted evidence and are taking it to him. If you destroy the commandos, we'll make it look like Lago was responsible. Will you do it?",	"npc_2_4":"I knew you'd do it! Now listen: There are four storm commandos, all heavily armed. Put together a large strike team. Good luck!",	"npc_3_4":"Well, I can hardly blame you. This is a high-risk mission. I hope we can find someone else up to the danger.",	"npc_4_4":"Sikander and Lago will be at each other's throats, and they'll give that much less attention to the Alliance. Couldn't happen to two nicer fellows. Now, what do you say?",	"npc_backtowork_4":"You should get to work now. A lot is riding on you.",	"npc_reward_4":"Phenomenal work! I think the Alliance can use you higher up -- literally. I'd like you to talk to Pooja Naberrie, a former senator, at Dee'ja Peak. Here's a ticket to get there. May the Force be with you!",	"npc_work_4":"You should be at work. A lot is riding on you.",	"npc_noloc_4":"All right. The storm commandos are located at -- hmm -- I don't seem to have their coordinates. Check with me later.",	"npc_failure_4":"Well, I'm not surprised you couldn't defeat a team of storm commandos. We'll try a larger team in our next assault.",	"otherescort_4":"Imperial business. Move along.",	"dontknowyou_4":"Imperial business. Move along.",	"npc_breech_4":"A Rebel! Attack!",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"notit_4":"",	"player_reset_4":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_4":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_4":"Yes.",	"player_2_4":"No.",	"player_3_4":"What do you gain by making Sikander think that Lago destroyed the storm commandos?",	"npc_1_5":"",	"npc_2_5":"",	"npc_3_5":"",	"npc_4_5":"",	"npc_backtowork_5":"",	"npc_reward_5":"",	"npc_work_5":"",	"npc_noloc_5":"",	"npc_failure_5":"",	"otherescort_5":"",	"dontknowyou_5":"",	"npc_breech_5":"",	"npc_takeme_5":"",	"npc_dropoff_5":"",	"npc_smuggle_5":"",	"gotowork_5":"",	"notit_5":"",	"player_reset_5":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_5":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_5":"Yes.",	"player_2_5":"No.",	"player_3_5":"",	"npc_1_6":"",	"npc_2_6":"",	"npc_3_6":"",	"npc_4_6":"",	"npc_backtowork_6":"",	"npc_reward_6":"",	"npc_work_6":"",	"npc_noloc_6":"",	"npc_failure_6":"",	"otherescort_6":"",	"dontknowyou_6":"",	"npc_breech_6":"",	"npc_takeme_6":"",	"npc_dropoff_6":"",	"npc_smuggle_6":"",	"gotowork_6":"",	"notit_6":"",	"player_reset_6":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_6":"I'll keep working on the mission.",	"player_1_6":"Yes.",	"player_2_6":"No.",	"player_3_6":"",	"npc_reset_2":"All right, I understand. When you're ready to work with us, I hope you'll return.",	"npc_reset_4":"All right, I understand. When you're ready to work with us, I hope you'll return.",	"npc_reset_3":"All right, I understand. When you're ready to work with us, I hope you'll return.",	"npc_reset_5":"All right, I understand. When you're ready to work with us, I hope you'll return.",	"npc_reset_6":"All right, I understand. When you're ready to work with us, I hope you'll return."
