		"cant_work":"I'm a lady that demands exclusivity. Come see me when your schedule clears up a bit.",	"dontknowyou_1":"This is a CorSec matter. Move along.",	"dontknowyou_2":"I'm busy and can't help you.",	"dontknowyou_3":"I'm busy, pal! Buzz off!",	"dontknowyou_4":"Get lost. I'm busy.",	"gotowork_1":"I'm not sure what you expect me to do with this but I can assure you I don't want it.",	"gotowork_2":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"next":"You've performed like a true professional. I could ask for nothing more. Come back later, though, and I may have some more work.",	"notit_1":"",	"notit_2":"",	"notit_3":"This is not the ledger I asked you to bring me. I really need that ledger.",	"notit_4":"",	"notyet":"Sorry, I can't talk now.",	"npc_1_1":"Greetings, stranger. Are you looking for work? There's plenty of work around here for an enterprising and adventurous sort, such as you appear to be. But don't worry - I like to take things slowly. This first assignment is a simple delivery, a message for a business associate of mine. Think you can handle that?",	"npc_1_2":"One of my devoted employees has run afoul of the law. It may have had something to do with that message you delivered to that CorSec captain. I need someone to save my devoted friend the trauma of an \"interrogation\" - few beings survive such an ordeal. Could you save him?",	"npc_1_3":"As you know, I am very protective of my devoted employees. What you may not know is that I am equally as proactive when it comes to removing traitorous employees. One of my formerly trusted accountants has decided to sell some of my books to the Hutts. This not only saddens me deeply, it calls for me to hire someone like you to get those records back and silence this traitor for good. Are you the agent I'm looking for?",	"npc_1_4":"Those Hutts, so incredibly predictable. I've just received word that they've hired an assassin to take me out. What they don't realize is that I've done my homework and I happen to know that they intend to get rid of this assassin after he's done his job - the Hutts hate loose ends. I need you to meet this assassin and say a simple phrase. This will convince him to join the winning side - mine. You'll still have to deal with Hutt gangsters, however, but you've proven so good at that I have no doubt this will be a breeze for you. Will you do it?",	"npc_2_1":"Wonderful. Take this message to the CorSec captain at these coordinates. The contents of the message may come as a bit of a shock to him so pay no mind to anything he might say to you, especially threats. Report back to me when you're done.",	"npc_2_2":"I was hoping I could count on you. My people are tracking the movements of the CorSec guards and will transmit the coordinates to you. Please hurry.",	"npc_2_3":"You make me weepy, you're so good. Fortunately, I put a tracer on all my books so I am able to find them quickly should I need to. Make sure you get the ledger and leave no witnesses. I hate having to resort to this sort of thing but sometimes it's necessary.",	"npc_2_4":"You are nothing if not a professional. Say the phrase to the assassin and take out his escort. If I played my cards right, the assassin will not interfere. Good luck.",	"npc_3_1":"This business is not for everyone. Enjoy your stay here.",	"npc_3_2":"I understand if you don't wish to become involved in this matter. After all, one should never cross CorSec without a very good reason.",	"npc_3_3":"My assignments are getting a bit sticky, aren't they? Your refusal does not hurt my feelings.",	"npc_3_4":"This is a tricky mission. Perhaps I should rely on a more experienced agent.",	"npc_4_1":"The kind that always gets a prompt response and gives the recipient little choice but to accept my generous proposal. Don't you just love messages like that? So will you do it?",	"npc_4_2":"Not in this case, no. I have a feeling that the CorSec captain that ordered this \"interrogation\" will not want his superiors to become involved. This is a personal matter between him and I, you see.",	"npc_4_3":"They believe that someone like me is not capable of running the local Black Sun activities on this planet. It has to do with my past, which I won't go into in detail, but suffice to say that not long ago I was traded among the Hutts like a piece of property. Times have changed and now I must do my best to re-educate them. Something that I enjoy immensely.",	"npc_4_4":"Jaggah Jonz never left Nal Hutta. You want to retire on the \"Glorious Jewel?\"",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_5_4":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_6_4":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I know I'm very pleasant company but you should get going.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"No time to waste, dear friend. My employee's life is at stake.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"There's an accountant out there who desperately needs your attention.",	"npc_backtowork_4":"The more time you waste, the closer that assassin gets to me.",	"npc_breech_1":"What's your business here? This is a CorSec investigation.",	"npc_breech_2":"But I didn't do anything wrong! Why am I to be interrogated? I'm innocent!",	"npc_breech_3":"I know Lady Slinthiss will send someone after me. It's only a matter of time. Doesn't that worry you people?",	"npc_breech_4":"You said that Lady Slinthiss would send someone and it seems you were right. I was hired to take out a Lady Vigo. This is your problem.",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"I'm glad you decided to work for Lady Slinthiss. I would have been so much bantha fodder had that not been the case.",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"I salute a fellow professional. Let's hope we never find ourselves on opposite sides of a business transaction.",	"npc_failure_1":"I'm sure you tried your best, but failing to deliver a simple message does not bode well for your future.",	"npc_failure_2":"I lose more employees this way. Believe it when they say that good help is hard to find.",	"npc_failure_3":"Now I'll have to set off the explosive charge in the tracer. It'll take me months to collect all that data again. I hate these sorts of setbacks.",	"npc_failure_4":"Looks like I may have to disappear for a while, assuming I can't find someone else to take care of this killer for me.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_1_2":"They wanted to squeeze me for information concerning Lady Slinthiss' operations. But I wouldn't have talked, I swear! She sent you to bring me back safely, right?",	"npc_more_1_3":"I didn't! I swear! I was framed! By, by -- the Hutts! Yeah! That's it! The Hutts framed me, those slimy slugs! They mind controlled me! Is any of this getting through?",	"npc_more_1_4":"Ah, now I understand. Okay, you've bought yourself a reprieve. Take me back to your boss. I think she and I have business to discuss.",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_2_4":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_more_3_4":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Let me verify the captain's coordinates with my people. Check with me in a few.",	"npc_noloc_2":"My people just need to verify those coordinates. Could you check back with me in a few moments?",	"npc_noloc_3":"One moment while my people verify the ledger's location.",	"npc_noloc_4":"One moment while my people verify the assassin's current coordinates.",	"npc_reset_1":"Oh, I know, I can be so demanding. Come back when you're ready for such a bossy employer.",	"npc_reward_1":"Well done. I hope that mean old CorSec captain didn't upset you too much. These sorts have a much more ferocious growl than they do bites. Those temperments suit these security roles, I suppose.",	"npc_reward_2":"You've brought my employee back safe and sound. Wonderful! Please have a drink on me.",	"npc_reward_3":"You put many of my other agents to shame. But they need that in order to strive for something better. You're tops in my view.",	"npc_reward_4":"You are a businesswoman's most valuable asset, do you know that? Take some time off, you Corellian sand panther, you've more than earned it.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"What's this? A message from Nurla Slinthiss? It's a holo recording of some sort -- Wait a second! Is this what I think it is? You tell that good-for-nothing gangster I won't be blackmailed! You hear me! Now get out of here before I have you arrested!",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"A thousand thanks, friend. Please take me back to Lady Slinthiss. More of those CorSec goons may show up at any minute.",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_takeme_4":"Not bad. Looks like I'll have to deal with you myself. Ready?",	"npc_work_1":"Did you deliver that message for me? A business deal is dependent upon that delivery.",	"npc_work_2":"Have you rescued my employee from those CorSec goons? He's ever so fragile.",	"npc_work_3":"Have you retrieved that ledger for me? My business will surely take a hit if that falls into the wrong hands.",	"npc_work_4":"Did you say that phrase to that assassin? My life could be in grave danger.",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"I'm not the fellow you're looking for.",	"otherescort_3":"",	"otherescort_4":"Get lost. I'm busy.",	"player_1_1":"Yes.",	"player_1_2":"Yes.",	"player_1_3":"Yes.",	"player_1_4":"Yes.",	"player_2_1":"No.",	"player_2_2":"No.",	"player_2_3":"No.",	"player_2_4":"No.",	"player_3_1":"What kind of message is this?",	"player_3_2":"If I fight CorSec personnel to save your friend, won't I be arrested?",	"player_3_3":"Why are the Hutts after your \"books?\"",	"player_3_4":"What phrase do you want me to say?",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"",	"player_4_3":"",	"player_4_4":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"",	"player_5_3":"",	"player_5_4":"",	"player_more_1_1":"",	"player_more_1_2":"Why were you arrested?",	"player_more_1_3":"Why did you betray Lady Slinthiss?",	"player_more_1_4":"Jaggah Jonz never left Nal Hutta. You want to retire on the \"Glorious Jewel?\"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_2_3":"",	"player_more_2_4":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_more_3_3":"",	"player_more_3_4":"",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_1":"I'll get back to work.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"Report back to Nurla.",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"Escort the employee back to Lady Slinthiss.",	"return_waypoint_description_3":"Bring the ledger back to Lady Slinthiss.",	"return_waypoint_description_4":"Escort the assassin back to Lady Slinthiss.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Nurla Slinthiss' Location",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Nurla Slinthiss' Location",	"return_waypoint_name_3":"Nurla Slinthiss' Location",	"return_waypoint_name_4":"Nurla Slinthiss' Location",	"waypoint_description_1":"Deliver a message to a CorSec captain.",	"waypoint_description_2":"Rescue Lady Slinthiss' employee from the CorSec goons.",	"waypoint_description_3":"Get the ledger from the accountant.",	"waypoint_description_4":"Speak a phrase to an assassin.",	"waypoint_name_1":"CorSec Captain's Location",	"waypoint_name_2":"Devoted Employee's Location",	"waypoint_name_3":"Traitorous Accountant's Location",	"waypoint_name_4":"Assassin's Location",	"npc_reset_2":"Oh, I know, I can be so demanding. Come back when you're ready for such a bossy employer.",	"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",	"player_sorry_2":"I'll get back to work."
