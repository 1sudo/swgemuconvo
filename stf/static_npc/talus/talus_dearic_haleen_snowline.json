Check with me when you're not so busy.",	"dontknowyou_1":"You have the wrong person.",	"dontknowyou_2":"You want to be leaving this area pretty quick.",	"gotowork_1":"I expected a contribution to the Talus and Tralus Liberation Party from the office of the Prime Minister.",	"gotowork_2":"",	"next":"Hello again. The Prime Minister can see you now.",	"notit_1":"",	"notit_2":"",	"notyet":"I'm sorry, I can't speak with you right now.",	"npc_1_1":"Hello. I'm Minister of Protocol for the Prime Minister. He can't see you right now, I'm afraid. But if you want to help the government of Talus, I have an errand for you. This contribution must be delivered to members of the Talus and Tralus Liberation Party. Would you be so kind?",	"npc_1_2":"I'm afraid the Prime Minister remains busy. However, a new matter has arisen that demands authoritative action. Terrorists from the fringe Talus and Tralus Liberation Party have stolen valuable state secrets. I urge you to retrieve these secrets and resolve this situation regarding these insurgents. Will you help us?",	"npc_2_1":"Excellent. The Liberation Party representative has, for reasons I'd prefer not to explain, arranged a rendezvous in the wilderness. Please return here after you have made the delivery.",	"npc_2_2":"Splendid.

However, this office cannot offer advice regarding this specific situation, in actuality or by implication. I'm sure you understand. Will you do it?",	"npc_5_1":"Our position is that secession is inadvisable. Naturally, though, we support Talusian democracy, and are happy to foster intelligent political discussion. I believe that explanation must suffice for now.",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_6_1":"His schedule is quite full. However, he can sometimes make time for individuals who perform exemplary service to the government. On that topic, would you please make this delivery?",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"I don't know what else to tell you. Will you deliver that contribution to the Liberation Party representative? I'd appreciate speed.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"I have nothing else to tell you.

Fire!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_failure_1":"It disappoints me that you could not deliver that contribution to the Liberation Party. There may be unpleasant consequences for our party. Meanawhile, I'm sorry to say that the Prime Minister remains unavailable.",	"npc_failure_2":"This terrorism remains a blight upon our freedom-loving society. I'm sorry to report that the Prime Minister remains occupied at this time.",	"npc_more_1_1":"Did the Prime Minister think no slicer would look into those tariff exemptions?

I suggest you contact me again shortly for the coordinates.",	"npc_reset_1":"I understand perfectly, though I confess disappointment. I hope you'll reconsider.",	"npc_reward_1":"I suggest you regard with suspicion any allegations regarding the Prime Minister's activities. Meanwhile, he remains busy, but I hope you will contact me again soon.",	"npc_reward_2":"Thank you. I believe you'll find it prudent to avoid mentioning this disc's content, or our involvement in this situation. The Prime Minister will see you now.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"Thanks. You can tell the Prime Minister that our officers still have that evidence, so he can expect to hear from us again.",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_work_1":"Will you deliver that contribution to the Liberation Party representative?
