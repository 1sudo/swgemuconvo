		"npc_1":"Welcome to Watto's Junk Shop.  What can I do for you?",	"player_1":"Where's Watto?",	"player_2":"Who are you?",	"npc_2":"Watto had some unexpected business back on his home planet.  I'm running things while he's away.",	"player_3":"Well, I'll wait for him to come back.",	"player_4":"That sounds awfully suspicious.",	"npc_6":"Suit yourself.  If you'd rather deal with the Toydarian that's your business.",	"npc_7":"Suspicious?  You think I'd hurt my own business partner?  Actually...that's not a bad idea...",	"npc_3":"My name is Wald.  I grew up here on Tatooine.",	"player_5":"Really?  Why are you working here?",	"player_6":"You've been here that long?",	"npc_4":"I went into business with Watto many years ago.  Now I run the store when he's away.",	"npc_5":"I was here when Anakin Skywalker won the Pod Races!",	"player_9":"Wow.  I have no idea what you're talking about.",	"player_10":"That's amazing!",	"npc_10":"You don't?  I thought everyone had heard about that.",	"npc_11":"Well, what can I say.  I've had an amazing life.",	"player_7":"What does that mean really?",	"player_8":"Why would you work with Watto?  Isn't he mean?",	"npc_9":"No.  You just have to know how to handle him, really.",	"npc_8":"Mostly it means sitting here counting junk while no one comes in to buy things.  Pretty dull really..."
