		"npc_1":"Plenty to do on Corellia.  Easier than working on Naboo.  Safer than Tatooine.  Did you come looking for work?",	"player_1":"What kind of work?",	"player_2":"No.  I'm not interested.",	"npc_2":"If you don't know then you probably don't want it.  Not the kind of work for strangers or those who don't know.  Ya know?",	"player_3":"Um...I don't know.",	"npc_6":"Exactly.  And if you don't know then you can't know can you?  So you should move on, before you know too much.",	"player_4":"Strangers?",	"npc_7":"Anyone I don't know is a stranger.  You know?",	"npc_3":"Too bad.  I got a lot of work and no good people.",	"player_5":"You think I'm good people?",	"npc_4":"You could be.  You seem fit enough.  Are you?  Are you any good at all?",	"player_7":"What's the job?",	"npc_8":"You don't seem to know what we're talking about so I'm going to assume you already have another job and just go on about my business.",	"player_8":"I'm good.",	"npc_9":"Then find one of my people and see what kind of work we have.  You'll know them when you see them.  Or you won't.  You know?",	"player_6":"What's the job?",	"npc_5":"There's not just one.  There are tons of jobs.  But I need good people.  Not just anybody off the street that strikes up a conversation.",	"player_9":"I can do the work.",	"npc_10":"I'm sure you can.  See what my people have and we'll see how you do.  If you're really any good you won't need my help finding them.",	"player_10":"Ok, you're too weird.",	"npc_11":"Nothing wrong with weird.  What worries me is you.  Right?"
