		"get_to_it_chief":"Well, get back to work!",		"working_on_it":"No, I'm still working on that.",		"wheres_imggcu":"Get your hands on those IMGGCUs. I need the grenade casings to start causing some serious trouble here on Lok.",		"wheres_drive":"Have you found that memory module yet?  That should be your top priority now.",		"youre_done":"I appreciate the work you did for us.  You're still in my good graces, so feel free to roam around on Lok.  ",		"now_imggcu":"Nice job, but I still need the grenade casing units. Bring me the IMGGCUs.",		"now_drive":"Good, but I still need the memory module.",		"your_the_best":"Great work. Kole and Jinkins can vouch for you, and now you've done your part for me. Feel free to visit the stronghold whenever you need supplies. Just don't bring along any trouble, and you'll always be welcome here.",		"go_to_officer":"Tell him I sent you, and he should squawk.",		"go_lab":"Get outta here, then. Bring me back what I asked for, and we'll do some business.",		"lab_info":"There are two things I want: First, I want all the research the scientists have done. Just grab a memory unit from one of the lab's computers. Second, I need some Imperial Military Grade Grenade Casing Units. The Imps call them IMGGCUs. There should be a stash of them somewhere in that base.  Bring me the memory unit and the IMGGCUs, and I'll make sure you're well-paid.",		"ill_go_lab":"I'm going into the lab, and nothing can stop me.",		"ill_see_officer":"I'll go talk to this guy.",		"retired_officer":"You might be able to help both of us out by talking to a "friend" of mine, an informant who might have some information about the research facility and its defenses. If you can stand talkin' to an immoral slug, I'll give you directions to his favorite hangout.",		"help_others":"I'm not going to take a chance on you until you earn Jinkins' trust and Kole's respect. Better get to work.",		"kole_quest_info":"Kole's interested in an Imperial mining facility on Lok. He'll give you more information about it.",		"jinkins_quest_info":"Jinkins has some information about a crashed starship carrying an Imperial droid. It could be useful to us. Ask him about it.",		"something_funny_jinkins":"Good. Just remember that we're watching you. Put a leg outta line, and I'll cut it off.",		"something_funny_kole":"Don't make him mad. He hasn't killed anyone in two weeks and I think he's gettin' bored.",		"ill_see_kole":"I'll go talk to Kole.",		"ill_see_jinkins":"Let me talk to Jinkins.",		"quest_info_again":"Like I said, I'm looking for someone who can bust into an Imperial research facility. ",		"tell_me_again":"Tell me again what you need from me...",		"imperial_bribe":"What can I do for you?",		"imggcu":"What is it you need from the research lab?",		"koles_story":"What kind of help does Kole need?",		"hello_again":"Well, well, you're back. Need something else?",		"jinkins_story":"What can I do for Jinkins?",		"quest_info":"You're persistent, I'll give you that. I might have work for someone too stupid to know when to give up, and you look like you fit that description. There's an Imperial research facility on Lok that my spies think is filled with experimental weapons. I want whatever that base is building. You'll need help from Jinkins and Kole if you want to pull this off.",		"kole_is":"Kole's my Chadra-Fan first mate and co-pilot. Rescued me from more than one assassination attempt, so watch your back and keep your hands where Kole can see 'em. We've been working together since before the Battle of Naboo. There isn't anyone I trust more.  ",		"jinkins_is":"Jinkins? He's the best engineer this side of Corellia. Anything I can blow up, he can put back together.   ",		"who_is_jinkins":"Tell me about Jinkins.",		"who_is_kole":"Who is Kole?",		"yo_es_nym":"I'm Nym, captain of the Lok Revenants. We're the largest pirate crew on Lok, and I'll crush anyone who claims different.  ",		"quienne_esta":"Who are you?",		"tell_me_quest":"I'm looking for work.",		"first_time_hello":"I don't know who you are or why you're here, and I don't really care. I assume you want some work, just like every other fringer who wanders into my stronghold. But just because you're tough enough to survive on my planet doesn't mean you're ready to join the Lok Revenants. I only take the meanest mercenaries into my crew. You gotta prove yourself before I'll even think about giving you any assignments. In the interest of keeping the peace, I'll let you stick around. But step out of line, and I'll send a blaster bolt through your brain. "
