		"npc_1":"Who do you work for?  Speak up!",	"player_1":"I'm here on my own.",	"player_2":"I'm part of a group...",	"npc_2":"Well, that can get you killed.  Do you know what there is around here?",	"player_3":"Jungle?",	"npc_6":"Money.  Parts of the Death Star that fell to the planet.  They're worth a lot to the right bidders.  And they're all mine, so stay out of my way and stay out of my people's way.",	"player_4":"Debris?",	"npc_7":"That debris is worth cold hard credits and I intend to cash out.   Just stay out of the way, all right?",	"npc_3":"I don't need to hear it.  As long as you're not here to stop me.",	"player_5":"Stop you from what?",	"npc_4":"Heh.  From collecting my due.  My salvage team is gonna reap the rewards of this stuff.",	"player_7":"What stuff?",	"npc_8":"Pieces of the Death Star.  They're ours for the taking.",	"player_8":"Salvage team?",	"npc_9":"That's right.  I run a tight group here.  We're gonna make a bundle.",	"player_6":"I'm not.",	"npc_5":"Good, cause I wouldn't have let you.  And neither would my team.",	"player_9":"Your team?",	"npc_10":"My guys are here to collect salvage, but don't think that means they're pushovers.  They'll take you down if I give the word.  Got it?",	"player_10":"I'm done.",	"npc_11":"Me too.  Talk to you later if you live that long."
