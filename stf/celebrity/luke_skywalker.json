You seem awfully familiar.",	"player_3":"Maybe, but I don't think we've met before.",	"npc_6":"I'm sure I'll remember it sooner or later.  Stick around and I'll let you know.",	"player_4":"You've confused me with someone else.",	"npc_7":"Yeah, maybe that's it.",	"npc_3":"I might be.  Who's asking?",	"player_5":"I have some friends in the Alliance...",	"npc_4":"What did they tell you?  That I'm a hero?  It's been a little overblown, but yeah, I was there at the Battle of Yavin.",	"player_7":"I hear you took out the Death Star personally.",	"npc_8":"There was a lot more to it than just me.  Lots of my friends died that day.",	"player_8":"It's an honor, sir...",	"npc_9":"Thanks.  I appreciate it.",	"player_6":"You're famous.",	"npc_5":"Famous?  I don't see how I could be famous.  Infamous maybe.",	"player_9":"Well, that's better than being famous.",	"npc_10":"Mostly it just means people trying to kill me.  I don't think I like infamous very much.",	"player_10":"You'd be surprised...",	"npc_11":"Almost nothing surprises me anymore."
