Just let me know if you need anything.",	"player_3":"Ok, will do.",	"npc_6":"Good.  Now I must get back to work.",	"player_4":"You're sweet.",	"npc_7":"Thank you again.  I'm going to blush.",	"npc_3":"My name is Mon Mothma.  I don't think you would have heard of me.",	"player_5":"I don't think so.",	"npc_4":"I'm not surprised.  I try to stay out of the public eye for the most part.  Comes with the job.",	"player_7":"What is your job?",	"npc_8":"Many people would die if I simply gave that information to everyone who asked.  I won't tell you just yet, but maybe if I get to know you better.",	"player_8":"Do you find it difficult to stay hidden?",	"npc_9":"Sometimes.  But there are so many things happening so quickly right now that it's becoming easier and harder at the same time.  I know, that doesn't make much sense does it?",	"player_6":"Mon Mothma?  I have heard of you!",	"npc_5":"Some people know my name.  Some know my occupation.  Hopefully you aren't a threat to me, I'd hate for us to be enemies.",	"player_9":"I just know your name.",	"npc_10":"Then you're safe for now.  Try not to ask too many questions in the future.",	"player_10":"I know you and what you do.",	"npc_11":"Then I hope we are allies.  "
