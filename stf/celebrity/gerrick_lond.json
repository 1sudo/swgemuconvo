		"npc_1":"Welcome to Jabba's town house.  What can be done for you?  Hmm?",	"player_1":"Jabba has a town house?",	"player_2":"I'm here to see Jabba.",	"npc_2":"Hmm?  Yes.  Of course he does.  Why?  Shouldn't he?  Hmm?",	"player_3":"No, I just didn't know.",	"npc_6":"Well now you do.  Hmm.",	"player_4":"Does he ever come here?",	"npc_7":"On occasion.  Mostly we do business from here, and keep Jabba's guests very comfortable.  Hmm.",	"npc_3":"I'm sorry, but Master is away at the Palace.",	"player_5":"You know that's actually a monastery, right?",	"npc_4":"The old B'omarr monastery?  Hmm...Believe me, it is Jabba's Palace.  No more, and no less.",	"player_7":"What about the monks?",	"npc_8":"Oh, those spider droids? Hmm? Believe me when I tell you that they know their place there.",	"player_8":"He stole it.  What if someone steals it from him?",	"npc_9":"I would feel pity for anyone who thought they could take the Palace back away from the master.  Hmm?  Oh yes.  Much pity.",	"player_6":"When do you expect him?",	"npc_5":"Hmm?  We don't expect the Master.  He comes and goes at his pleasure.  We strive only to serve.  Hmm.",	"player_9":"Why do you keep saying Hm?",	"npc_10":"It's a nervous tick.  Hmm.  I assure you.  Nothing more.  Hmm.",	"player_10":"Well, I guess I'll go check at the palace then.",	"npc_11":"Hmm.  And that is where you shall find him."
