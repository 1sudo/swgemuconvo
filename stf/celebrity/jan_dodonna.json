		"npc_1":"How are things going friend?",	"player_1":"Do I know you?",	"player_2":"Do you assume everyone's a friend?",	"npc_2":"Probably not.  Just being friendly is all. ",	"player_3":"Ah.  And who are you?",	"npc_6":"Just a tired old soldier.",	"player_4":"Well, thanks.  That's nice of you.",	"npc_7":"That's why I do it.",	"npc_3":"Until they prove otherwise.  Don't you?",	"player_5":"I never make assumptions.",	"npc_4":"You're probably the better man for it.  Me, I just can't think of people negatively until they've done something to lose my trust.",	"player_7":"That's encouraging.",	"npc_8":"I hope so.  But I also hope for the best all the time.  ",	"player_8":"That seems unwise.",	"npc_9":"Well, I'm just a silly old man sometimes.  But don't look at people too negatively.  Sometimes they can surprise you.",	"player_6":"I assume they're enemies.",	"npc_5":"That's a bit negative isn't it?  Surely you're just saying that to sound tough...",	"player_9":"Maybe a little.",	"npc_10":"Well, keep it to yourself, that's my advice.  People don't like a tough guy unless they need one.  Or unless they really are bad people.",	"player_10":"No, I'm serious.",	"npc_11":"I worry about the universe sometimes...and this is why."
