People don't like a tough guy unless they need one.  Or unless they really are bad people.",		"player_9":"Maybe a little.",		"npc_5":"That's a bit negative isn't it?  Surely you're just saying that to sound tough...",		"player_6":"I assume they're enemies.",		"npc_9":"Well, I'm just a silly old man sometimes.  But don't look at people too negatively.  Sometimes they can surprise you.",		"player_8":"That seems unwise.",		"npc_8":"I hope so.  But I also hope for the best all the time.

Me, I just can't think of people negatively until they've done something to lose my trust.",		"player_5":"I never make assumptions.",		"npc_3":"Until they prove otherwise.
