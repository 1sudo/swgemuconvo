		"em1":"So you're the new guy, huh?  My name is Ephant Mon, and you'll be working for me for a while.",	"em2":"What do you need done?",	"em3":"What do you do around here?",	"em4":"A friend of mine named Tash Kolt sent me a distress call that was jammed at the source. I don't know how serious the situation is, but I want you to find out.",	"em5":"Where should I start?",	"em6":"What do you suspect?",	"em7":"Start by talking to Hazir Gam'mur in Wayfar.  If anyone knows where Tash is, it will be Hazir.  I'll mark a location on your datapad where Hazir usually hangs out.",	"em8":"I'll get right on it.",	"em9":"I need to do some things first.",	"em10":"I used to be a smuggler for Jabba, but I'm getting too old for that now.  What I do now is advise Jabba in certain situations.",	"em11":"What do you advise him on?",	"em12":"Can you introduce me to Jabba?",	"em13":"Well, this and that.  He and I used to be partners a long time ago.",	"em14":"Can you introduce me to him?",	"em15":"Who lives in the palace?",	"em16":"You're going to have to get a bit more reputation before Jabba will pay any attention to you.  If you can get some work done you'll be well on your way.",	"em17":"It's hard to say with Tash.  He may be in some trouble with the empire, or it may be someone he's annoyed.",	"em18":"You don't seem particularly worried.",	"em19":"What can I do to help?",	"em20":"Well, Tash is in and out of trouble all the time.  It could just be a misunderstanding, but I'd like to know for sure.  Can you help me out?",	"em21":"Well, ok.",	"em22":"Maybe later.",	"em23":"That's fine, come back and see me when you have some time.",	"em24":"Well, there's Max Rebo, Barada, Bib Fortuna, Jabba, of course, and the Gamorrean Guards.",	"em25":"Tell me about Max.",	"em26":"Tell me about Barada.",	"em27":"Tell me about Bib Fortuna.",	"em28":"Tell me about Gamorrean Guards.",	"em29":"Tell me about Jabba.",	"em30":"Max is an Ortollan.  He's the band leader.  He seems to spend all his time thinking about his next meal, even when he's playing music.",	"em31":"Barada is Jabba's chief mechanic, and he also handles some of the mercenary work in the palace.",	"em32":"Bib is Jabba's Majordomo.  Everyone has to deal with him before speaking to Jabba directly.",	"em33":"The Gamorreans are fiercely loyal to Jabba, but not the brightest creatures in the galaxy.  They do their job well though, keeping out the riff-raff.",	"em34":"Jabba is a Hutt.  He's a powerful crime lord, and can be a useful ally.  Never cross him though.  No one has ever done so and lived long to talk about it.",	"em35":"How can I help you?",	"em36":"I'm a friend of Ephant Mon.",	"em37":"Do you know where I can find Tash Kolt?",	"em38":"Ephant Mon?  Did he send you to see me?",	"em39":"Yes he did.",	"em40":"No, but he's mentioned you.",	"em41":"Is there something I can do to help?",	"em42":"He's looking for Tash Kolt.  Do you know where he is?",	"em43":"Tell me where Tash Kolt is now!",	"em44":"Not at the moment.  I know he was having some problems.  Perhaps I can help you...",	"em45":"How?",	"em46":"Doesn't sound like it.",	"em47":"I know he was planning on moving, and that some thugs were looking for him.  If you find him, and those thugs are there, maybe you can help him out.",	"em48":"Great!  Tell me where!",	"em53":"Here.  I'll add the location to your datapad.  Good luck. ",	"em54":"I don't know anyone by that name.  Are you sure you're in the right place?",	"em55":"It's Ok.  I'm a friend of Ephant Mon.",	"em56":"I think you're lying.",	"em57":"Mentioned me in what context?  As a friend?",	"em58":"Yes.",	"em59":"Just as a contact.",	"em60":"You have quite the attitude don't you?  Well if you do know Ephant Mon then tell him that I don't deal with your sort.  Perhaps he has other friends he can send to talk to me.",	"em61":"If you've come to apologize then maybe I can help you.",	"em62":"You're right.  I acted rudely.",	"em63":"Apologize?  Forget it.",	"em88":"Wow!  You unloaded on those guys.  I've never seen anything like it!",	"em89":"Ephant Mon sent me to see how you were doing.",	"em90":"What are you doing?",	"em91":"Good thing you showed up then.  Think you can hang around and keep the thugs off me while I load up my stuff and move out?",	"em92":"Sure thing.",	"em93":"Well, I am kinda busy...",	"em94":"I'm loading up everything I own in the world.  Gotta keep one step ahead of these nerfherders.  I could use your help.",	"em95":"What do you want me to do?",	"em96":"I'm not loading boxes!",	"em97":"Could you just hang around and make sure nobody bothers me while I'm packing?",	"em98":"Sure thing.",	"em99":"Well, I am kinda busy...",	"em100":"Well, I understand.  Tell Ephant Mon he was a good friend.  I hope he won't miss my funeral.",	"em101":"Ok, ok, I'll help.",	"em102":"Will do.",	"em103":"What does it say?",	"em104":"Where is his home?",	"em106":"Thanks.",	"em107":"Thanks for nothing.",	"em108":"See you later.",	"em109":"Bye!",	"em110":"Well, I'm done packing.",	"em111":"Thanks for helping my friend.",	"em112":"No problem.",	"em113":"Here is your reward...",	"em114":"What should I do now?",	"em115":"Go and see Max Rebo.",	"em116":"Go and see Barada.",	"em117":"Go and speak to Bib Fortuna again."
