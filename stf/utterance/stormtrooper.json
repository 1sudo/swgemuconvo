",	"stormtrooper_npc_response_3_1":"Ok, I'm back to work.",	"stormtrooper_npc_greet_2":"Hail citizen.  What do you need?",	"stormtrooper_player_line_1_2":"Where can I get a cool suit of armor like that?",	"stormtrooper_npc_response_1_2":"This is the official uniform of the Imperial Stormtroopers.  You'd actually have to BE a stormtrooper to get one.",	"stormtrooper_player_line_2_2":"Oh.  Well, can I be a stormtrooper then?",	"stormtrooper_player_line_3_2":"That's too much work.

Just step away slowly and I'll let you go unharmed.  Okay?",	"stormtrooper_npc_job_offer_1":"There is something you can do for the empire, yes...",	"stormtrooper_npc_job_offer_2":"I was supposed to do this myself, but I'm backlogged on paperwork, so maybe you can handle it.",	"stormtrooper_npc_job_offer_3":"Sure,  I've got some work that needs to be done.",	"stormtrooper_npc_go_home":"Get out of the way if you're not going to help then.",	"stormtrooper_npc_do_job":"I'll be interested to know when you're finished."
