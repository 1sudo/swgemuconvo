Invite yourself only when you are ready to take part in the action.  You may invite your guild to your story using \"/storyInvite guild \"  You can see who's story another player is part of by examining them.   --------------------------------------  /storyRemoval This command allows you to remove someone from your story.

By default, Storyteller NPCs remain in the game for 16 hours. ",	"storyteller_help_npcs":"Storyteller NPCs:  There are two types of Storyteller NPCs: combat NPCs and flavor NPCs.   Storyteller NPCs may be placed by the Storyteller or any of his/her assistants.  By default, Storyteller NPCs remain in the game for 16 hours.  -------------------------------------- Combat NPCS  Combat NPCs are intended for exactly what their names implies: combat. Anyone who is part of your story may fight your combat NPCs and will also be attacked by your combat NPCs.   Storyteller combat NPCs do not award experience, faction points, GCW points, or anything of that kind.  You have a number of options for your combat NPCs:  You may set their combat level. This can be done directly on a combat NPC. You may also set the combat level on a combat NPc Storyteller token and those combat NPCs will be created at the specified combat level.  You may put loot on your combat NPCs. When a combat NPC in your story is killed by a player in your story, they will be able to take whatever loot you have placed.  You may toggle your combat NPCs between loitering and standing still.  You may switch a combat NPC to be a flavor NPC. Note that this is not reversible...you may not make a flavor NPC back into a combat NPC. One way only.  You may destroy a combat NPC. This deletes the NPC as well as any loot you may have placed on it.  -------------------------------------- Flavor NPCs  Flavor NPCs are essentially decoration. They do not take part in combat and cannot be attacked by other players, whether part of your story or not.  One special type of flavor NPC is the storyteller vendor. This vendor is very much the same as the ones found in most cities except that only the Storyteller who placed him may purchase Storyteller tokens from him. The flavor NPCs only last for 1 hour. ",	"storyteller_help_effects":"Storyteller Special Effects:  There are two types of Storyteller special effects: immediate effects and persistent effects.  Immediate special effects are effects that will play once and then go away. These may be targeted to a location or to a Storyteller prop or NPC.   Persistent special effects are effects that can be played on a Storyteller prop or NPC that will remain until the prop or NPC is destroyed. A persistent special effects may also be removed by the Storyteller or replaced with a different persistent special effect.
