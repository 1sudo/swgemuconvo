I'm going home.",		"kaja7_reply1":"I'll have to change everyone's attitude then.",		"kaja7":"Well, the emperor has lost several good agents trying to protect the governor, so it was decided that we would use someone, a little more...um...non-essential.",		"kaja6_reply1":"And the second reason?",		"kaja6":"To be perfectly honest there are two reasons.  The first is, the Emperor wants to test your resolve.  See how good you really are.",		"kaja5":"That is most unfortunate.

Don't be too long.",		"kaja2":"One of the regional governors needs an escort due to some unpleasantness.  I'll mark his location on your datapad, and you can escort him to his ship.",		"kaja1_reply2":"I am too busy at the moment.  I'll come back later.",		"kaja1_reply1":"I am.  What is it that must be done?",		"kaja1":"The Emperor has requested you personally for this task.  I hope that you are prepared to show your loyalty to the Empire."
