Adds a pleasant fizz to food or drink.  (Significantly increases the Mind effects of foods that are crafted with it but at a cost to the Health effects.)",	"bio_component_clothing_casual_charisma":"Clothing impregnated with this timed-release psychoactive agent subtly enhances the wearer's confidence. Cynics suggest the effect derives entirely from the manufacturer's galaxy-wide marketing campaign (\"Charigra -- the sweet smell of success\"). Illegal on certain puritanical Core Worlds.",	"bio_component_clothing_casual_charisma_2":"This expensive psychoactive agent induces trust and good feeling, even toward strangers. However, long exposure neutralizes the effect. When impregnated in cloth fibers, Personaphene vapors make others subconsciously trust the wearer, but the wearer is immune to the effect. Popular among ambitious Imperial officers.",	"bio_component_clothing_casual_entertainer":"Genetically altered crystal snake scales are ground down and used to treat cloth. Light reflecting from the moving cloth induces a relaxing, hypnotic effect. Many celebrated entertainers wear clothes of myoflex cloth to enhance their performances.  (Casual Clothing made using this component gets a bonus to the Wound Battle Fatigue (Dance & Music) skill modifiers.)",	"bio_component_clothing_casual_entertainer_2":"Advanced Tissue Engineering techniques enhance the hypnotic effects caused by light reflecting through altered crystal snake scales.

(Casual Clothing made using this component gets a bonus to the Cure Efficiency & Augmentation Efficiency skill modifiers.)",	"bio_component_clothing_casual_taming":"With trifling power requirements drawn from the wearer's nervous system, these miniature crystals vibrate at subsonic frequencies detectable by most animal life. The vibrations exert a calming effect that makes an animal more receptive to commands.  (Casual Clothing made using this component gets a bonus to the Taming Wild & Vicious Creatures skill modifiers.)",	"bio_component_clothing_casual_taming_2":"These highly complex sensors, worn as patches on clothing, can identify a nearby animal and produce pheromones that target the animal's sympathetic nervous system. This calms the animal, possibly even during combat.  (Casual Clothing made using this component gets a bonus to the Taming Wild & Vicious Creatures skill modifiers.)",	"bio_component_clothing_field_camo":"These time-release microspheres, when impregnated in cloth fibers, release vapors that dull the sense of smell. The wearer can move more easily among wild animals without alarming them. Not coincidentally, the microspheres release greater quantities of vapor in the presence of nervous sweat -- presumably when the wearer most needs camouflage.  (Field Wear made using this component gets a bonus to the Camouflage & Mask Scent skill modifiers.)",	"bio_component_clothing_field_camo_2":"Complex micromachines implanted in cloth analyze the scent molecules that pass through the fabric and modify them to remove odors.
