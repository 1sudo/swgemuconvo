		"jaq1":"My henchmen seem to have problems working together so you will put your own team together to work my next task. ",	"jaq2":"I can do that. ",	"jaq3":"What is my next mission? ",	"jaq4":"Lady Valarian has acquired a valuable Rantok Sword, and I will possess it.  Go see Belshu Dadar at the Mos Eisley Cantina for more information. ",	"jaq5":"Yes, Lord Jabba. ",	"jaq6":"Do you know where the sword is? ",	"jaq7":"That is why I'm sending you to see Belshu.  He knows more about the sword. ",	"jaq8":"Yes, Gracious Master. ",	"jaq9":"I need time to put my team together. ",	"jaq10":"Then come back when you have them gathered.  Careful that you don't waste too much time.  If I don't get my hands on that blade I will be very disappointed. ",	"jaq11":"So, you're Jabba's new errand boy, eh?  What do you need to know? ",	"jaq12":"I need to know where Valarian's keeping this Rantok sword. ",	"jaq13":"What do you know about Valarian's security? ",	"jaq14":"I don't know exactly where the sword is, but I know someone who might. ",	"jaq15":"Who would know such things? ",	"jaq16":"What do you know about Valarian's security? ",	"jaq17":"There's a slicer in Mos Eisley named Sliv Jurek.  He owns Jurek Security.  He may have some ideas about where the sword is. ",	"jaq18":"Why would he know? ",	"jaq19":"What do you know about Valarian's security? ",	"jaq20":"He helped her put together some of her security countermeasures, so he probably knows where she'd keep such a thing. ",	"jaq21":"What do you know about Valarian's security? ",	"jaq22":"Ok.  I'll go see him. ",	"jaq23":"I know that Sliv is probably the guy she hired to install it, so he's the man to see. ",	"jaq24":"You must be Bib Fortuna's friend.  I've heard about you. ",	"jaq25":"Well, how bout you do me a favor then?",	"jaq26":"What do you know about Valarian's security? ",	"jaq27":"Don't assume just because you're Bib's friend you get free advice. ",	"jaq28":"I am working for Bib Fortuna... ",	"jaq29":"True enough.  How bout we work out a deal? ",	"jaq30":"Tell you what, you slip me, say a hundred credits, and I'll tell you everything you ever wanted to know about Valarian's security. ",	"jaq31":"A hundred?!?  How bout ten? ",	"jaq32":"Sure thing. ",	"jaq33":"Ten?  I could get eighty for it by just grabbing the next guy off the street.  Make it 75. ",	"jaq34":"Grab a guy off the street then, cause I'm not giving you more than 20. ",	"jaq35":"75 it is. ",	"jaq36":"Shrewd businessman that you are, I'll make you a deal.  Everything I know for 50. ",	"jaq37":"I can go as high as 30. ",	"jaq38":"For 50 you've got a deal. ",	"jaq39":"Sorry, I'm not going any lower than that. ",	"jaq40":"Fine, I'll come back when you've come to your senses. ",	"jaq41":"Ok, ok, here's 50. ",	"jaq42":"Do you want to do business or do you want to argue? ",	"jaq43":"Ok, let's do some business. ",	"jaq44":"Let's argue.  How bout you tell me what I want to know or I'll kill you. ",	"jaq45":"Ok, what would you like to know? ",	"jaq46":"What do you know about Valarian's security? ",	"jaq47":"Do you know where Valarian is keeping the Rantok sword? ",	"jaq48":"I know that Valarian recently ordered enough components to put together two brand new turrets for base defense. ",	"jaq49":"Just two? ",	"jaq50":"What else? ",	"jaq51":"Two is plenty to rip a team of thieves to ribbons.  Besides, that won't be the only thing stopping you. ",	"jaq52":"How can I get past the security? ",	"jaq53":"What else? ",	"jaq54":"You'd better take a damn good slicer with you, I know that for sure.  She has a tendency to use lower level security on the crates but the turrets will require top notch slicing. ",	"jaq55":"Why use the lower level security on the crates? ",	"jaq56":"What else? ",	"jaq57":"She likes to let the thieves get in, boost their confidence, and then gun them down with the turrets.  Cuts down on repeat customers that way. ",	"jaq58":"Sounds evil. ",	"jaq59":"What else? ",	"jaq60":"Oh, she is.  And you'd better believe there will be guards around, making sure that if you do try to hack the turrets it won't be without distractions. ",	"jaq61":"Do you know where Valarian is keeping the Rantok sword? ",	"jaq62":"Anything else? ",	"jaq63":"Guards, electronic countermeasures, the turrets, you name it, she's bought it. ",	"jaq64":"No, but I can tell you exactly who will.  A wookiee named Daracca is the guy you'd take to appraise that too.  I'll bet she dragged him out there to check it out, wherever it is. ",	"jaq65":"Where can I find this Daracca? ",	"jaq66":"I'd say we're pretty much done talking now. ",	"jaq67":"Daracca hangs out at the Rockribbon Cantina in Mos Espa.  He's very into the dancers there.  If he's not around try his friend Cora, she may know where he is. ",	"jaq68":"So you're looking for Daracca?  He's a nice enough fellow.  Always eager to impress us.  He tells us lots of things. ",	"jaq69":"Do you know where I can find him? ",	"jaq70":"What kinds of things? ",	"jaq71":"Not so fast, hot stuff.  Daracca's off planet for a while, but I probably have the information you're looking for if you want to trade. ",	"jaq72":"What would you like to trade? ",	"jaq73":"Do you know where Valarian might be keeping a Rantok sword? ",	"jaq74":"I need someone to retrieve something very valuable for me.  Daracca would normally do it, but like I said, he's out of the loop. ",	"jaq75":"What is this item? ",	"jaq76":"You want me to do your dirty work? ",	"jaq77":"It's a necklace that's very special to me.  A bith stole it from me last night, and I need someone to get it back for me. ",	"jaq78":"Where can I find this bith? ",	"jaq79":"Why would this bith steal your necklace? ",	"jaq80":"He usually hangs out down by Fasser's Pawn shop.  He'll probably be trying to sell my necklace as soon as he gets up the nerve. ",	"jaq81":"All right, I'll bring you the necklace and you tell me what you know.  Deal? ",	"jaq82":"I have enough jobs already.  I don't need another one. ",	"jaq83":"Good enough for me, sweetie.  See you soon. ",	"jaq84":"Well, he tells me where he goes, who he sees, where certain people keep certain things. ",	"jaq85":"Like, maybe where Valarian might keep a stolen Rantok sword? ",	"jaq86":"Sounds like Daracca's quite the talker. ",	"jaq87":"Yeah, I know that one.  You want to find out for yourself then you have to do me a favor. ",	"jaq88":"What kind of a favor? ",	"jaq89":"I've had enough of doing people favors. ",	"jaq90":"Well, then you can find out what you want on your own can't you?  See you later. ",	"jaq91":"Don't think of it as dirty work, honey, think of it as the necessary means to an end. ",	"jaq92":"Ok, what's the item? ",	"jaq93":"Sounds like dirty work to me.  I'm not interested. ",	"jaq94":"He's a failed musician.  He keeps coming around here trying to get a job, but he's terrible!  So he hates everyone here.  He was looking for a little revenge. ",	"jaq95":"How did he get the necklace? ",	"jaq96":"Where can I find this bith? ",	"jaq97":"He punched me in the face last night as I was heading home.  Snatched if off my neck and ran off. ",	"jaq98":"What a jerk! ",	"jaq99":"Where can I find this bith? ",	"jaq100":"Tell me about it.  So can you help a girl out? ",	"jaq101":"I've had enough of doing people favors. ",	"jaq102":"Where can I find this Bith? ",	"jaq103":"Well, he likes to impress people, like I said.  Especially us dancers. ",	"jaq104":"How can I help out? ",	"jaq105":"What do you want? ",	"jaq106":"I just want to talk to you. ",	"jaq107":"Where's Cora's necklace? ",	"jaq108":"What could we possibly have to talk about? ",	"jaq109":"Oh, this and that. ",	"jaq110":"How bout we discuss Cora's necklace? ",	"jaq111":"How bout we discuss how much pain I'm going to cause you! ",	"jaq112":"Thank you.  All right.  Daracca told me where he was examining the sword, and that that's where she's keeping it.  I hope you're not planning on breaking in alone.  I'll add the location to your datapad. ",	"jaq113":"Thanks for your help. ",	"jaq114":"Don't worry about me. ",	"jaq115":"Handling a bith musician is one thing, and don't think I don't appreciate it, but Valarian's compound is something else entirely. ",	"jaq116":"I have friends. ",	"jaq117":"I'm not worried. ",	"jaq118":"Be sure to take them with you.  It'd be dangerous otherwise, and I think I'm starting to like you. ",	"jaq119":"Aw...shucks. ",	"jaq120":"Thanks for the warning. ",	"jaq121":"Well, just be careful, that's all. ",	"jaq122":"You've done very well!  Very well indeed!  My retainers have prepared a special gift for you on this fine occasion.  This statue will link you to us here at the palace.  You can place it in your Association Hall, or your home, and use it to find work at any time, day or night. "
