		"wheredoibegin":"Welcome to Star Wars Galaxies! You have taken your first steps into a galaxy far, far away.  If this is your first time playing, it may seem a little overwhelming.  This help area, the Holocron, is your guide to learning everything you need to know to live in this world.  If at any time you are lost, or you need help on a topic, come to this screen.  You can press Control-H to access the Holocron at any time.  We'll remind you periodically (as you discover new things in the game) about this screen, and lead you back here. If you want to learn more about the Holocron, you can select \"About the Holocron\" from the topic list to your left.  If you need to go back over what you learned aboard the space station, you can select \"A Recap of the Tutorial\" from the topic list to your left.  If, on the other hand, you are ready to begin your adventures, press the button below and we'll start out by giving you a tour of your starting city. ",	"welcometoswg":"Star Wars Galaxies is a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG). That means that it's a virtual world on the Internet, to which thousands of players can connect simultaneously and have shared adventures. Everything you do will happen on the game servers, and the game will continue whether or not you are logged on.  You've just left the space station where the Empire processed you as a refugee, and you've been unceremoniously deposited on one of the planets in a starting city. The primary planets in the galaxy each have two or more major cities, and these major cities provide the same basic amenities. We'll take you on a tour of these key locations.  Before going exploring, however, it might be a good idea to take some time to try out all the navigation and interface tips that were given to you in the tutorial. If you need a refresher, this Holocron has a recap of the tutorial, available in the list of topics to the left.  For now, you should try    -- moving around. The arrow keys always work, regardless of what keyboard mapping you are using.   -- getting used to switching between mouse cursor mode and mouselook mode. This is a key part of the interface in Star Wars: Galaxies. By default, changing modes is accomplished with the ALT key.   -- speaking out loud. By default, you do this by simply typing.  If you dislike the default keyboard mappings, you can change them to a fresh default set, or map your own. We have default settings for EverQuest players, first-person shooter players, and isometric game players (such as Ultima Online or Lineage). You can learn more about the game interface by selecting the \"Interface\" topic from the list to your left.  ",	"aboutholocube":"This screen, the Holocron, is an interactive help system. On the left, you see a tree view of categories. You can open up categories by clicking on the yellow squares next to them . Clicking on the category name will display text in this window, related to the subject chosen. You can collapse a category by clicking on the doubled yellow squares.  As with all interactive screens in Star Wars Galaxies, there is a built-in Help function. You can check or uncheck the box in the upper right corner of the window at any time. It will automatically uncheck after you go through the tooltips once.  When you start out in Star Wars Galaxies, we open up the Holocron automatically for you at key points in the game, to guide you through the experience of learning how to play. Everything under the \"Where Do I Begin?\" section can be considered to be part of a tutorial on how to play Star Wars Galaxies. Even if your particular tutorial experience doesn't take you to every part of this section, we suggest that you may want to glance through it--you never know when you might want to switch profession tracks, for example!  However, the automatic tutorial doesn't even begin to cover all the material in the Holocron. You might want to take the time to explore the rest of the Holocron as well. It serves as an interactive manual, and covers many subjects beyond what the tutorial does, including basic travel guide information about the planets and creatures you may encounter in the game. It even includes a handy Glossary of Terms.",	"tutorialrecap":"This section of the Holocron offers a recap of the tutorial on the space station that occurs right after character creation. It's possible to skip this tutorial, so you may have missed it--but we have you covered.  Simply click through the topics to the left to read through basic instructions on navigation, chatting, and interacting with the world.",	"lookandmove":"Let's try looking around. To do so, simply move the mouse. If you have a cursor up, you'll need to move it until it is pushing on the edges of the screen. You can look up or down or anywhere you want.  If you have a mousewheel on your mouse, you can use it for zooming the camera in and out. Scrolling up will zoom all the way into a first person view, and you can scroll down to zoom all the way out to a fairly large distance. In fact, if you prefer, you can zoom out to there, tilt the camera down, and play the game from an overhead view.  Pressing the up arrow will move you forward in the direction you are currently looking. To change the direction in which you are moving, you will need to look in a new direction. You can do this by moving the mouse around. Pressing the down arrow will move you backward and the left and right arrows will move you sideways.  You can also move using the right mouse button. When you're in mouselook mode, the right mouse button acts exactly like the up arrow--it moves you forward. Right now, because you're reading this Holocron, you happen to be in \"mouse cursor mode.\" The next topic explains what that means. ",	"mousemode":"Star Wars Galaxies has a modal interface. This means that you need to hit a key to switch between what we call \"mouse cursor mode\" and \"mouselook mode.\" Right now, because you have this window open, you are in cursor mode.  Tapping ALT on your keyboard will switch between the two modes. If you think you'll only be in the other mode for a brief moment, you can also hold down ALT to switch, and when you let the key go, you'll switch back automatically. This works regardless of which mode you were in to start with.  When you switch out of mouse cursor mode, all the windows that require a cursor to operate will vanish. Don't worry, they're not gone forever! They'll return automatically when you enter mouse cursor mode again. Try it now, and you should see this Holocron go away, and then return when you switch modes again.  Looking around varies a little bit depending on which mode you are in. If you're in mouse cursor mode, moving the cursor to the edge of the screen will cause the camera to pan in that direction. If you're in mouselook mode, it's even simpler: just moving your mouse will change the direction in which you are looking.  There's a few ways to move around; you can use the mouse or the keyboard to do it.  Regardless of which mode you are in, you can always use the arrow keys to move.   You can also move using the right mouse button. When you're in mouselook mode, the right mouse button acts exactly like the up arrow--it moves you forward.  When you're in mouse cursor mode, though, pressing on the right mouse button means \"move towards the cursor.\" This works best when you have zoomed out all the way and are looking at your character from overhead.  ",	"chatwithplayers":"Chatting with other players is very simple. Just type. As soon as you hit the ENTER key, your text will be sent out and can be read by anyone who is nearby.  You'll notice that the text you type appears at the bottom of your screen in what we call the INPUT BAR. This is part of your CHAT BOX. You can see the text that you've spoken, as well as what others have said, in the chat box.  Your text also appears over your head in a CHAT BUBBLE. There's lots of styles and appearances for chat bubbles, which helps to identify the tone of the speaker.  There are a lot of more advanced chat options in Star Wars Galaxies. You can read about them in the Holocron by choosing any of the topics under \"Communication\" from the topic list to the left.",	"lookatobjects":"To look at objects in Star Wars Galaxies, all you need to do is move your camera until your cursor or reticle is over the thing you want to look at. If it can be interacted with, blue brackets will pop up around it, and the object's name will appear.  If it's a living being, you may also get to see its status. From left to right, the elements that appear beside the name are:  - a number that indicates how accurate you will be trying to hit it with your equipped weapon. If you're out of range, it'll show as three dashes like this: ---  - the being's health, action, and mind stats. These show up as red, green, and blue bars respectively, and are often affectionately called the \"HAM bars.\"  - the \"con meter.\" This is a little colored explosion icon that indicates how tough the being would be in a fight. Green means it's easy, blue somewhat easy, white slightly difficult and yellow through red means it's increasingly tougher to kill.   You probably don't want to tackle anything with a con other than green or blue at first, until you know more about the game.",	"usingobjects":"You can use an object by just double clicking on it with your cursor. You'll notice that when you hover your cursor, or reticle, over an object, the shape of the cursor changes. The shapes indicate what action will be performed when you double-click. For example, a plate with a fork and knife means that double clicking on it will allow you to eat the object. A large, red encircled 'X' means that you'll attack it.  For most beings you see in the cities, the default choice will be to examine the being or converse with it. In some cases, you'll be able to attack it.  There are many more things you can generally do with objects in the world. The next topic, on \"The Radial Menu,\" will explain how you can perform more complex actions on objects.",	"radialmenu":"If you click and hold down the mouse button while hovering over an object, or NPC, you will get an expanded menu of options. We call this the RADIAL MENU. Options for interacting with the object will appear in a circle around the object.  It can take a little while to fetch all the available options from the server. As long as the blue \"downloading\" animation is playing, there are still more options that have yet to be displayed. When it stops moving, then you know that all the options have been downloaded.  The option at the top is always the default action that will be performed if you double click on the object.  To choose an option, simply move the mouse to the option you want, and let go of the mouse button once you're over it.  Radial menu options can have submenus as well. If you hover for a moment over a button, you might see additional choices pop up as a submenu on that button.",	"conversations":"One of the options on the radial menu for almost every NPC you encounter is \"Converse\". When you select this option, a special interface will open on top of the selected NPC.  On the left side of this display will be the speech spoken by the NPC, and on the right side will be a multiple choice listing of possible responses you have available. One of the options will be \"Stop Conversing\", which will end the conversation. You can click on the options while in mouse cursor mode or while in mouselook mode.  You can move around during the conversation, by the way. You don't need to stand still. The conversation will automatically end when you get too far away from the NPC.",	"containers":"Some objects are containers, and one of the choices on the radial menu will be \"Open\". (If it's an NPC's corpse, the option will be called \"Loot\" instead, but it means the same thing).  When you open a container, you will see a container window. This window shows you the contents of the container. You can pick things out from the container and drag them into another container or into your inventory. ",	"inventory":"You have a special menu called your \"Inventory\" that lets you carry the items you find in Star Wars Galaxies. You can reach it either by pressing CTRL-I or by pressing the inventory button on your button bar in the lower left corner of the screen. You can identify the inventory icon, on the button bar, with a suitcase.   Your Inventory has a limited capacity, and there's a bar at the bottom showing you how much room you've taken up. Items that are currently equipped or are being worn will show up with a green background.  After finding a container or corpse with items in it, you'll probably want to drag those items to your inventory.",	"toolbar":"Along the top middle portion of your screen you will see your Toolbar. The Toolbar allows you to place hotkeys (keys to which you have quick access) to abilities and items for easy access. You can add items to your Toolbar by simply left clicking on an item or ability icon and dragging it onto one of the boxes.   You can instantly access any of these hotkeys by pressing the corresponding function key on your keyboard (F1 through F12). Right clicking on any of these hotkey boxes will bring up an options menu allowing you to perform the hotkey'd action, remove the hotkey, bind the hotkey to a key or enter a description for that hotkey.   You have a total of six banks of hotkeys that you can toggle with the up and down arrows on the left hand side of the Toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+~ in the default keyboard setup.   In addition, if you find yourself in need of more Toolbar space, you can left click on the lower portion of the toolbar and drag it down to reveal a second set of hotkey boxes for each bank. This second row of hotkey boxes is accessed by pressing Shift+the corresponding function key (Shift+F1 through Shift+F12).  If you find that using fuction keys are cumbersome to your gameplay, you can reassign your hotkeys to the keys of your choosing. You may do this through your \"Options\" menu.",	"buyingitems":"As you are moving around the cities in Star Wars Galaxies, you will see various kind of terminals that will allow you to purchase items and equipment to aid you in your adventure.  To access these terminals and purchase items target the terminal and double-left click on it. A menu listing the items available on this terminal will display. Left click to choose one and then click on the purchase button. The credits for the item will be removed from your character and the item will be placed into your inventory.  Be aware that you can attempt to buy items when your inventory is full. Make sure you keep some room for your purchases.",	"bank":"The bank in Star Wars Galaxies has many useful functions for the adventurer. You can use the bank to store money and items safely to free up space in your inventory.  If you double click on a bank terminal, it will open the credit transfer option by default. If you left click and hold on the use option of the radial menu, more options will become open to you. The options available are \"Withdraw All Credits\", \"Join Bank\", \"Quit Bank\", \"Safety Deposit Box\", and \"Withdraw/Deposit\".  \"Withdraw All Credits\" allows you to remove any credits you have in the bank and place it in your cash pool. Note: Trading with players often requires you have cash with you while many terminals and services can draw funds directly from your bank.  In order to access a safety deposit box, you have to join a particular bank. Once you have selected \"Join Bank\", you will have access to the \"Safety Deposit Box\" and \"Quit Bank\" options. The safety deposit box option will open a small window in which you can drag items from your inventory for safekeeping. However, the safety deposit box is limited to a specific planet. For instance, if you \"Join Bank\" and opt to use the safety deposit box on Tatooine, you cannot access it on Naboo.  \"Withdraw/Deposit\" is the default action when you double click on a banking terminal and is the option that lets you transfer specific amounts between your cash and bank pools. ",	"dying":"In Star Wars Galaxies, when your Health, Mind, or Action pool reaches zero, you will become incapacitated. Being incapacitated is similar to being knocked unconscious and does not mean that your character has died. If you are incapacitated, there will be a timer at the bottom right corner of your screen that will represent how much longer your character will remain in the incapacitated state.  Sometimes creatures, NPCs, or other players might decide to go ahead and actually kill your character after it has been incapacitated.  This is commonly referred to as a \"Death Blow\". Don't worry - your character is not dead permanently.  When your character has been killed, a menu will pop up with your cloning options. We will cover these options in the next section.",	"cloning":"Cloning is the term used in Star Wars Galaxies to refer to the system that allows your character to respawn after being killed. When your character dies, a menu will pop up with your cloning options. These options will always include \"Clone closest Uninsured\". What does that mean? We will explain it.  You can always clone to the nearest cloning facility but let's say that you decided you want to go to a specific place regardless of where you died. To do this you would need to go to the cloning facility in the city you want to respawn in and pay a cloning fee to save your characters clone at that location. Now if you die you will have two options \"Clone closest Uninsured\" or \"Clone designated Uninsured\". The designated facility is the one you saved your clone at while the closest will vary depending on your location.  It is of note that just because you save your clone at a location does not mean that you saved your character, you have only specified the prefered location to clone at. When you clone in Star Wars Galaxies you will retain all the experience and skills that you had earned up to the point of your death, however you will also retain all of your wounds.  When cloning without insurance you will receive a waypoint to the location of your corpse. If you proceed back to the location of your death you can loot your corpse and regain any items and cash that were on your character upon death.  Should your cloning options fail to appear for some reason, you can use the command /activateclone If that still does not work for you use the emergency only command /activateclone now",	"insurance":"When you die, certain items in your inventory take 5% damage. Insuring an item will reduce this to 1% damage (or 0% if you suffer a Faction death).   You can purchase insurance from the insurance terminals inside of a cloning facility. You have the option of selecting individual items to insure or to simply insure all of your items. Note: Depending on the number of items you have and their value, insurance can be expensive. ",	"equipment":"To use an item or piece of equipment, simply left click and hold on the item in your inventory. The radial menu will pop up displaying the options you have for manipulating that object.  If the object is a piece of clothing, armor or a weapon, you will have the option to equip it. This will place the item onto your character. You can also do this quickly by double clicking the item in your inventory. Items that are currently being worn or are equipped on your character will highlighted in green.  If the object is a piece of food, a medical stim pack, crafting tool or similar item, there will be a \"Use\" option. If you click your mouse over the use option, more options may appear specific for the item. For instance, you can hold your mouse button on a surveying tool. The \"Use\" and \"Examine\" choice will expand from the activated radial menu. If you move your cursor to \"Use\", and continue to hold down the mouse button, you will additionally receive a new option to choose beneath it.",	"combat":"Creatures or NPCs (Non Player Characters) that you can attack will have red, or yellow, names above their heads when you target them. To engage in combat, left click on the NPC to select it as your target. You now have two options.  1) left click and hold on the target to pull up the radial menu and select attack. 2) use the tilde key (~) to open the radial menu and click attack or press the corresponding option number (if attack is on top it would be option one, if attack is the second option it would be two).  Your character will automatically go into combat mode upon selecting attack. Assuming you are in range, your character will begin to attack the target with default attacks. You and your target will continue to exchange attacks until one of you flees or is incapacitated.  Max range is 64m for ranged weapons. Max range on most melee weapons is about 3-8m.  The range of your target is displayed in the upper right hand corner by the target's name.  If you are out of range, the accuracy numbers to the left of the target's status bars will show as a --- symbol.",	"experience":"As you adventure in Star Wars Galaxies you will gain experience. In order to learn new skills and advance your character, you will need to meet the requirements of that skill. Skills have both prerequisite requirements and experience requirements. For instance, you cannot immediately  learn Advanced Carbine Skill; you would have to learn Intermediate Carbine Skill first. The only skills that do not have an experience requirement are the Novice skills of all the starting professions.  What is a Novice skill? A Novice skill is the basic skills a given profession would have as a starting adventurer. For instance, Novice Medic skill will grant the ability to heal wounds and damage, while Novice Entertainer will give the ability to dance and play music.  You can access the skills window by pressing Ctrl+S or by clicking the lightning bolt in the button bar at the bottom right hand corner of your screen. In the skills window, you can view the skills trees for the professions your character has on the \"My Professions\" tab or by clicking on the \"All Professions\" tab. You can view the skill trees for all professions in the game.  Let's say we want to learn Novice Scout. We need to find a Scout trainer.  Scout trainers are found in the Commerce Guild. To quickly find a Commerce Guild, you'll want to type /find and select \"Commerce Guild\" from the window that opens (selecting an option from the \"find\" window produces a waypoint for your convenience). If we go to the newly-created waypoint, we will find a Scout Trainer inside the building with whom we can converse. Conversing with the trainer will result in several options, one of which is \"What skills can I learn\". Selecting this option from his conversation list will display the skills he can currently teach, and you can currently learn. For example, a Scout Trainer can teach scout skills, but cannot teach skills that an Entertainer Trainer would teach.   Clicking on a skill, provided that you have enough experience points and credits, will tell the trainer that you'd like to learn that particular skill.  ",	"missions":"Missions are a way for you, as an adventurer, to run errands for NPCs (Non Player Characters) to earn credits and have some fun. You can get missions from a mission terminal or by talking to NPCs  When you get a mission, an entry will be made in your datapad. You can access your datapad by pressing Ctrl+D or by clicking on the little battery icon, located on the button bar, in the bottom right portion of your screen. You can left click and hold on the icon in your datapad to choose options like viewing the mission details.  When you activate a mission waypoint an orange arrow will point the direction to your target. As you get closer to the target, you will see a beam of light coming from the sky directing you to where you want to be.",	"intheworld":"Here you are, fresh out of the tutorial and just off the shuttle. The sections below one will help you answer the question of \"What do I do now?\".  We will cover things to help you get going in your starting profession and assist you in finding what you need in your chosen starting city.",	"exploring":"We're going to start out by introducing you to the important buildings in your city. You will be visiting these buildings many times while playing Star Wars Galaxies. It's important that you familiarize yourself with their location, appearance, and function.  Don't worry if it takes you a while to remember where these building are. We'll also teach you about the tools available to help you find important things in the game.  Let's start out by getting our bearings. If you hit Ctrl+M, you can open the overhead map of the area around you. This will give you some idea of where you are and what buildings are around you that might not be in view. You may want to spend some time just walking around to get a little more familiar with the city before starting the city tour.  As you walk around town with this map open, you will notice that important areas are marked on the map.  When you are ready press the button below to begin the your tour of the city. ",	"findskilltrainer":"When you are ready, we'll show you the way to the nearest Skill Trainer for your chosen profession.  Pressing the button below will close the Holocron and create a Waypoint to your Skill Trainer.  Once you have arrived at your Skill Trainer, the Holocron will open again and we'll continue the tour.

Pressing the button below will close the Holocron and create a Waypoint to the nearest Cantina or Theater.  Once you have arrived at the establishment, the Holocron will open again and we'll continue the tour. ",	"playingartisan":"Artisans play an integral role in Star Wars Galaxies. While primarily a non-combat profession, Artisans are the backbone of the economy.  Want to own a house someday? You will need an Architect. Want to get a new blaster? Better find a Weaponsmith. Need some Armor? You will need to look to an Armorsmith. All of these professions started as Artisans.  The starting Artisan profession will give you a taste of all the facets of the wonderfully complex and interesting crafting system.  The following sections will teach you about the different facets of the Artisan profession and what they can become.  When you are ready, we'll start by teaching you about Draft Schematics. ",	"artisandraftschematics":"Draft Schematics are the blueprints of Star Wars Galaxies. As an Artisan, you can check what draft schematics you have by viewing the draft schematic tab on the Datapad (Ctrl+D).  As you gain skill levels in the various Artisan skill tree branches, you will acquire new schematics.  So what exactly are these schematics?  Draft Schematics contain all the needed information for your crafting tool to create an item.  By looking at the schematic, either in your Datapad or Crafting Tool, you'll be able to see what kinds of materials and how much of each the schematic requires.    The most basic ingredient of all crafted items are raw resources.  (We'll teach you more about resources in a moment.)  Advanced schematics will require higher quantities of resources as well as very specific resources or rare resources.  In addition to raw resources, some schematics require crafted components.  These components are crafted using other Draft Schematics.  You may not always know how to make the component required by your schematic or it may not be worth your time to create it yourself.  In these situations, you will want to seek out other players to buy the components from.  You're probably pretty excited to start crafting items right away, but first you are going to need to learn how to get the resources that are needed to craft with.  When you are ready, press the button below and we'll learn how and where to get resources. ",	"artisanexperience":"Artisans gain experience in two different methods.  The first method is by extracting and harvesting resources. Resource harvesting gives the Artisan surveying experience that can be used to go up the survey tree of skills.  The second method is by crafting items. Not just crafting items but crafting items that other people use. This means,  in order to gain experience, you must not just make five survival knives, you need to give or sell these knives to people who will put them to use for you to get experience.  As an Artisan you will only use general crafting experience but as you progress to other professions the experience will become more specific. Examples are Weaponsmiths gaining Weapons Crafting experience, while Architects gain Structure Crafting experience.  Press the button below to learn about the Artisan disciplines. ",	"artisanresources":"You can acquire resources in a number of different ways. You can acquire them yourself with your surveying tools, use a Harvester to get them for you, or purchase them from another player.  The most common way an Artisan gains resources is by surveying and sampling. There are survey tools for each of the inorganic resource types and one for organic flora objects.  The different types are Mineral, Chemical, Gas, Water Vapor, and Flora.  The first time you use your survey tool, you will have to hold down on the tool until \"Tool Options\" pops up on the radial menu. Click on \"Set Range\" and choose the one range you have available. (As your Surveying skills increase additional options will become available.) Now that you have done this, you can use the tool.   Using the Survey Tool causes the surveying window to pop up. On this window you will see a list of the resources you can survey for with this tool. Select one and click survey. If the resource is found in the area it will be displayed on the little map and a waypoint to the highest concentration will be placed. If this is the type of resource you want to acquire then move to that waypoint and survey again. Continue to do this until you reach the highest concentration in your area. Note: Resource pools can go anywhere from 1% to 100% concentration.  Once you find a good concentration, click the get sample button. Your character will automatically begin to attempt to retrieve samples until one of three things happens. 1) You move 2) You run out of action or mind pool for sampling 3) You exhaust the sampleable resource in the immediate area.    Note, exhausting the sampleable resources in the immediate area doesn't mean that the resource pool is exhausted, only the easily acquired resources near the surface.  Moving just a couple meters is often sufficient to allow you to continue sampling resources.  Harvesters are able to retrieve resources deeper than your surveying tools can and can continue to retrieve resource from a single location until the resource pool is depleted.  Surveying for raw resources can also be a good way to make a little money.  NPCs in Star War Galaxies will sometimes hire you for Survey Missions.  Click the button below to learn more about these Survey Missions. ",	"artisancrafting":"Crafting in Star Wars Galaxies is accomplished by using a crafting tool. As a Novice Artisan you will start out using a generic crafting tool that will allow you to craft all kinds of basic items. Later on, as you use more advanced Draft Schematics, you will need to use specific tools to create more complex items.  The complexity of the Draft Schematic will determine what kind of tool you need to craft the item.  Only schematics up to complexity 15 can be crafted with the generic crafting tool.  Use the crafting tool and select the item you wish to craft from the list. You will be taken to the assembly screen and there will be a box with, and in it, the resources that you have that can be used for this schematic. Double click or drag resources into the appropriate boxes. (ie. Metal into a slot requiring metal or polymer into a slot requiring polymer.) You must use the same resource to fill a slot. This means you cannot take two different types of copper and put them in the same slot. It would need to be a stack of the same resource in order to be used in a single slot. When all slots are full that are required for the item, you will need to click assemble. It is possible to fail. Once you have succeeded, you will get a screen telling you how the item turned out. Continue on to the next screen in the crafting interface and name your item. After doing this and continuing again, your crafting tool will generate the prototype. You will see the numbers on your crafting tool count down and the item will be deposited in your inventory. Note: the pop up help can be very useful the first couple times you craft and will help guide you through this.  More advanced crafting is possible with specific crafting tools and crafting stations.  Crafting stations are very useful when crafting items and are very easy to use.  You only need to be standing near the correct type of crafting station and your special crafting tool will automatically connect to the station to take advantage of its advanced features. Using a Crafting Station will allow you to experiment with the final product and could increase its value and usability.  Click the button below to learn more about advanced crafting. ",	"artisandisciplines":"There are four disciplines or skill trees inside the Artisan profession.  Engineering: This skill tree concentrates on the creation of mechanical type items and is the prerequisite for the Weaponsmith, Armorsmith, Architect, and Droid Engineer professions.  Domestic: This skill tree is specialized on the creation of both clothing and food items and is the prerequisite for the Tailor and Chef.  Business: This is the specialized skill tree for the management of vendors and is prerequisite for the Merchant profession.

These missions have been posted by various citizens throughout the city and only wait on an enterprising entrepreneur to accept the job.  When you first look at the Mission Terminal, it will have a list of currently available missions.  You do not have to take the first missions offered to you, however.  You can always search for others if the current missions do not suit you.  Each mission listed in the mission terminal will have a short description of task required as well as the payment offered for completion.  As soon as you accept a mission, it will be downloaded into your personal Datapad.  A waypoint will be set to the first destination you need to go to.  What you need to do at that destination depends on the mission you have chosen; you may need to pick up some sensitive documents or you may need to engage some vicious smugglers.

Upon completion of the mission, the agreed upon payment will automatically be deposited into your bank.  You can have two mission contracts active at a time.

Sometimes these missions are a bit more underhanded than those you may receive from a Mission Terminal so be careful whom you talk to or you may find yourself on the wrong side of the law.  Don't forget you can always cancel a mission at anytime after you've accepted it. If you find that the task is beyond your skill or doesn't fit within your personal moral code, you can always cancel without a penalty.

These emotes are used at the beginning of a chat sentence and will change the context of your sentence.  Some of them will also change the appearance of your chat bubble for added effect.  For example, you could type, \"/yell Help me!!\" to cause your chat bubble to change and to make your chat audible to people further away.  Or you could type \"/growl Leave me alone.\" to cause your avatar to scowl while saying the sentence.  Experiment a little and see what's possible.  You find that emotes can add a whole new level to your conversations.  Another tool to add an emotional level to your conversation is to set your mood.  Changing your mood will change the way your avatar behaves as well as letting people know in your chat messages.

The world is big and no one person will be able to do everything.  Perhaps you have the skills the person next to you is looking for.  Whether it's as simple as someone needing a Medic or Entertainer to heal them, or an Artisan requiring a bodyguard while they search for rare resources, it's guaranteed that someone out there could use some help and you have the perfect skill set to assist them.  Talk to people, don't be afraid to ask around for jobs.  Perhaps you have a job in mind but need more people to help out, ask for assistance and you're sure to find the help you need soon enough.  Find the local hangout and stay around there for a while.  If you are unsure of where to find people, try the Cantina - everyone ends up there eventually.

When viewing your Friends list, you will be able to see at a glance which ones are currently online and which one are not.  Additionally, you can be notified whenever a friend comes online.  By setting the Listen option on, you will be notified whenever that person comes online.  This will only work if they have their Broadcast option selected for you, however.  It is possible someone wants a bit of privacy and doesn't want people knowing instantly when they come online.  You have the same choice by turning off the Broadcast option for a friend you will set it so that they will not get a notification when you come online.  A useful flip side to the Friends list is the Ignore list.  This is a list of player whom you would like to ignore.  It is useful for those situations where someone may be annoying you.  Add them to your Ignore list and all of their chat comments will be filtered out and you'll never have to hear from them again.  Press the button below to learn about the in game Matchmaker system.

When you are through playing Star Wars Galaxies, take your character to a safe place, somewhere within a city or camp site will work.  Then sit down using the /sit command and type \"/logout\" to quit.  After a short period, you will exit the game and your character will be safe and sound waiting for your return.  If you do not do this, your character will stay at the spot you left it for a couple minutes and could be attacked by passing creatures, so remember to always find a safe place before quiting.  Hopefully, you now have a better understanding of the basic game concepts and are not quite so overwhelmed.  There is a lot more to learn about Star Wars Galaxies, however.  At any time, you can look through this Holocron to find more detailed explanations of the various game system.
