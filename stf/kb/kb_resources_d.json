		"resources":"Star Wars Galaxies includes an extensive and diverse Resource Tree.  These resources are used to craft various kinds of items by the skills artisans throughout the galaxy.",	"classesandtypes":"A tangible, instantiated, and ready-to-use resource in the game is a resource type. Resource types are transported in resource containers and in a specific number of units. All the resources in the game are organized into groups called classes. A resource class is inclusive of all the resource classes and types that inherit from it. For example, class Metal is under class Mineral, so metals are minerals with additional specifics attached to them. Anything that demands a higher-level class such as 'mineral' will also accept anything that inherits from that class, such as 'metal'.",	"attributes":"All resources have attributes. Resource attributes are quantified on a 1-1000 scale. Higher means more.  The complete list of resource attributes used in the game is as follows:      Cold Resistance     Conductivity     Entanglement Resistance     Flavor     Heat Resistance     Malleability     Overall Quality     Potential Energy     Resistance to Decay     Shock Resistance     Toughness  A resource type will never have all the possible resource attributes, and what attributes it does have is determined by what class it is. The values of those attributes are determined by random selection from a possible range, again determined by the class.  Don't make assumptions about what is important to a particular schematic and what isn't. The draft schematic itself is the single source of information on what specific resource attributes are important to it, and how important they are ",	"resourcetree":"The following is a tree of all the available resource classes that can be found throughout the galaxy.
