		"tradein":"The pet trade-in system allows non-Creature Handlers with unusable pets (levels 11-15) to exchange their defunct creature for a usable, lower level one.  

To trade in your old pet, drag it onto a Creature Handler Trainer NPC.  The NPC will confiscate your old pet, and will return a lower level pet (that you will be able to control as a non-Creature Handler) similar to your old one.   The new pet will retain any commands your old pet had, as well as the name of your old pet.

The trade is irreversible.  The system only works for non-Creature Handlers who have unusable pets between levels 11-15.
