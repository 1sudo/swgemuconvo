		"m1d":"Local Imperial patrols have been relying on a refueling depot not far from here. The depot's destruction would certainly hamper the Empire's ability to effectively search for our cells. The Empire realizes this, so the depot is likely to be well defended. This mission will require skill and fortitude. Can the Alliance depend on you to lead such a strike?",	"m1o":"",	"m1s":"Now that's how it's done! Those Imperial patrols will stay grounded for a while. Long live the Alliance!",	"m1t":"Ground the Imperial patrols",	"m2d":"A transport repair station at these coordinates services Imperial scout troopers' speeder bikes. If this facility were destroyed, it would limit the number of Imperial search-and-destroy missions for this entire system. Can we count on you to orchestrate this strike? As always, the Alliance will reward you for services rendered.",	"m2o":"",	"m2s":"Broken down speeder bikes don't do the Empire any good. Job well done, agent. The Alliance could use more fighters like you.",	"m2t":"Take out the Imperial mechanics",	"m3d":"A small SoroSuub weapons testing facility must be knocked out. We believe they are working on an improved design for the scout trooper blaster. The Alliance can't afford to have scout troopers get better sidearms. We don't know what kind of security this facility will have, but we imagine it'll be formidable. You might need help.",	"m3o":"",	"m3s":"Bravo! No new blasters for those scout troopers! An impressive bit of work, agent. The Alliance thrives because of individuals like you. May the Force be with you.",	"m3t":"No new Imperial blasters",	"m4d":"We've located a major Imperial power droid manufacturing plant. Taking this plant out would be more than a simple inconvenience for the Empire. Their Star Destroyers and garrisons rely on these power droids to keep battle stations running. It will take a strong, precise strike to cripple this installation. The Alliance needs your help.  ",	"m4o":"",	"m4s":"No power means no weapons or defenses. Our congratulations on the success of your mission. Keep up the good work. The Alliance is counting on you.",	"m4t":"Farewell power droids",	"m5d":"We've identified an ISB compound used for interrogations. If the stories are true, terrible atrocities have taken place there. Destroying this facility would send the right message to both the Empire and to citizens who live in fear of Imperial Security. We're looking for a dedicated agent who can lead a successful assault on this nightmarish compound. Are you that agent? ",	"m5o":"",	"m5s":"Bravo, agent! Now citizens will realize that the power of the ISB is not absolute and that the Empire is fallible. You've earned your reward.",	"m5t":"Take out the torturers",	"m6d":"We've located a Sienar Fleet Systems warehouse and have learned that it's currently storing ion engines scheduled to go to Imperial shipyards in this sector. That will mean more TIE fighters for our X-wing pilots to deal with. We need someone to destroy that warehouse and everything inside.",	"m6o":"",	"m6s":"The distinctive roar of those TIE engines is greatly diminished today. Great job, agent. We knew we could count on you.",	"m6t":"No more ion engines",	"m7d":"An Imperial Academy processing center is currently housing the results of several hundred potential pilots' flight exams. If those scores are destroyed, this will create a severe backlog for the Imperials and slow their recruitment efforts. Further, it would let us approach potential recruits and possibly enlist their aid against the Empire. Do you wish to lead this important mission?",	"m7o":"",	"m7s":"Excellent! The best thing about the Empire's ponderous bureaucracy is that it's easy to throw a hydrospanner into the works. Good job! May the Force be with you.",	"m7t":"Burn Imperial records",	"m8d":"A cargo of probe droids has been delivered to a supply depot servicing this sector. A Star Destroyer is scheduled to enter the system's orbit in the next few days and those probe droids will be transported aboard. Those probe droids are trouble for the Alliance. We need a skilled agent to take out that supply depot and make sure those probe droids are destroyed.",	"m8o":"",	"m8s":"Good going! Fewer probe droids means fewer chances to find our bases. The Empire can't destroy what they can't find, after all. You're becoming a very promising agent indeed.",	"m8t":"Take out the probe droids",	"m9d":"We've discovered a shipment of turbolaser actuators stored in an Imperial depot. They are scheduled to be delivered to the Kuat Drive Yards. We must make sure those actuators are never installed in any capital ship's weapons. A team of skilled agents should be able to blast this depot off without much trouble. You'll have to work fast, though.",	"m9o":"",	"m9s":"Well struck, agent. Without their turbolasers, those hulking capital ships are just so much space debris. May the Force be with you.",	"m9t":"Pull the Star Destroyers' teeth",	"m10d":"A large shipment of orbital mines is to be delivered to the Star Destroyer Avenger. The dispersal of these mines would make life much more difficult for our fleet, as you can imagine. We've discovered these mines and need the depot blasted into oblivion. Can you lend a hand, citizen? ",	"m10o":"",	"m10s":"Good work, citizen! Those mines won't be claiming the lives of our pilots and crew members. We look forward to working with you again.",	"m10t":"Take out the deadly mines",	"m11d":"The Empire has designed an improved subspace transceiver. The working prototype was sent to a manufacturing facility for mass production. A small team of operatives must make sure those transceivers are never built and either secure or destroy the prototype. Can the Alliance count on you?",	"m11o":"",	"m11s":"It's obvious you know the meaning of success, citizen. Job well done! Even if we didn't get the prototype, its destruction is a good consolation prize.",	"m11t":"Knock out Imperial communications",	"m12d":"We have identified an Imperial fortified complex as a gunnery school for local recruits. Today they're firing at target droids, but tomorrow they'll be aiming at us. You have to destroy that compound -- today!",	"m12o":"",	"m12s":"Excellent work! The Alliance has nothing against education, but we don't like what the Empire does with it. We look forward to working with you again!",	"m12t":"No more Imperial gunners",	"m13d":"We've managed to locate the Imperial Intelligence Analysis Bureau command center for this entire sector. These centers provide the intelligence reports that allow the Bureau of Operations to plan and execute strikes. It will be heavily guarded and equipped with state-of-the-art defenses. Its destruction will require an experienced team. Can the Alliance count on you?",	"m13o":"",	"m13s":"A brilliantly executed strike! With freedom fighters like you aiding our cause, the Empire has no chance. We hope you'll accept difficult missions from us in the future.",	"m13t":"Cripple Imperial Intelligence",	"m14d":"We've discovered a training facility for Imperial Intelligence's Operations agents -- in other words, assassins. This installation has launched covert operations that have killed some of our top officers. The Alliance wants this base blasted into atoms. This will not be easy, as some of the Empire's top agents work as trainers at this facility.",	"m14o":"",	"m14s":"Those Operations goons never knew what hit them. Bravo! You've done the Alliance and the galaxy a great service. You're quickly becoming one of our top agents.",	"m14t":"Stop future assassins",	"m15d":"Bothan spies have identified a biological weapons development lab. Intercepted transmissions indicate this facility was instrumental in developing the Candorian Plague used against Dentaal. This lab must be destroyed at any cost. Imperial security will be tight and defenses formidable. A generous reward awaits the agent who can pull this off. ",	"m15o":"",	"m15s":"One less weapon in the Empire's arsenal. Good work! Many worlds will sleep easier now that this plague-making lab has been destroyed.",	"m15t":"Destroy the plague-maker",	"m16d":"A top-secret installation of the Inquisitorius, the Empire's specialized interrogators, has been located. Many of our agents ended up there, tortured for information until they were driven mad and killed. It is said that the Inquisitors use the Force to aid in their twisted work. Commander Skywalker has personally requested that this installation be taken out. Can we call on you?",	"m16o":"",	"m16s":"Success! You'll be the scourge of the Empire yet! The Alliance thanks you and the galaxy is in your debt. Our reward is but a small token of our gratitude.",	"m16t":"Smash the Imperial interrogators",	"m17d":"An Imperial garrison has received orders to execute suspected Alliance sympathizers and their families if they do not start naming Alliance spies. We need someone to wipe out the garrison before these stormtroopers can slaughter innocent civilians. Taking out a garrison, even a small one, is no easy task. These Imperial troops will be on high alert.",	"m17o":"",	"m17s":"Great job! The Empire will think twice before giving their garrisons the order to execute civilians again. Fear is not just a tool for the Empire.",	"m17t":"Save the innocent civilians",	"m18d":"A stormtrooper training facility, renowned for producing some of the Emperor's most fanatical legions, must be taken out. A successful strike would stand as a symbol of the Alliance's determination to rid the galaxy of the Empire's tyranny. The Emperor's brainwashing techniques can't compete with an Alliance member's passion for freedom. ",	"m18o":"",	"m18s":"You deserve a medal! The Emperor's not the only one who trains crack troops and deadly soldiers. The Alliance salutes you!",	"m18t":"Destroy stormtrooper training base",	"m19d":"Bothan spies have located an Imperial outpost housing Sith artifacts. We've received word that Darth Vader has ordered these artifacts delivered to him personally. If those artifacts are indeed what the Bothans claim, we must not allow them to fall into Vader's hands. We need a strike team to go in and blow that shipment to atoms.",	"m19o":"",	"m19s":"Job well done! You are a true champion of the people. Report to us again for future assignments soon.",	"m19t":"Destroy Sith artifacts",	"m20d":"Mercenary assassins do the Emperor's dirty work when direct military action is politically inexpedient. We have the coordinates of an undocumented arsenal from which the Empire supplies its assassins. We need a squad of fighters to blast the place into vapor. The arsenal is garrisoned with Imperial soldiers and mercenary assassins, so be careful.",	"m20o":"",	"m20s":"Astounding work! You and your team are superior operatives, a true asset to the Alliance.",	"m20t":"Smash an arsenal for Imperial assassins",	"m21d":"Imperial Army weapons designers have refashioned a platform-mounted flame carbine, the Czerka CZ-28 Flamestrike, for use on repulsorlift craft and cloud cars. Sheets of flame from the sky will mean grave danger for our fighters below. No matter the cost, you must render this weapons factory permanently inoperative. Prepare for harsh opposition.",	"m21o":"",	"m21s":"Impressive news! This victory represents a fundamental security that cannot be overstated. We applaud your resolve, and we wish you still greater success in the future.",	"m21t":"Imperial flamer munitions factory",	"m22d":"The profiteers at Arakyd Industries continue to garner Imperial largesse. These parasites have contracted to build new legions of Inquisitor-series seeker droids with weaponry of considerably increased lethality. This presents a major threat to Alliance forces, and we cannot allow the factory to begin production. Assemble a large and experienced strike team and take this factory out.",	"m22o":"",	"m22s":"This is excellent news! We hope this damages Arakyd Industries profits as badly as their products have damaged our forces. We congratulate you, agent!",	"m22t":"Blast a combat droid construction plant",	"m23d":"The Empire has established a new facility building two-legged AT-ST scout walkers. Though the labor force is entirely droid-based, the installation is well defended with Imperial troops. Our recon scout escaped only by dint of skill and luck. Assemble an experienced strike team to take out this major target.",	"m23o":"",	"m23s":"Your high reputation is well earned, agent! We have stalled the production of Imperial walkers in this area, at least for now. Your reputation continues to rise!",	"m23t":"Destroy an AT-ST assembly plant",	"m24d":"The Empire is relaying a cache of rare durindfire gems, under heavy guard, to a merchant in this area. You may know that Imperials traffic in these gems to finance their more exotic projects, such as the Death Star. If you can destroy these gems in their holding facility, you'll strike a blow against covert financiers across the galaxy.",	"m24o":"",	"m24s":"Durindfire gems flash brilliantly, but in Imperial hands they're covered with blood. It's better that you destroyed them. Good work!",	"m24t":"Blast the gems",	"m25d":"Imperial forces are guarding -- perhaps a better word is \"confining\" -- engineers working for Baktoid Combat Automata. In this compound these engineers are stress-testing blaster subsystems for a redesigned Protector-series combat droid. Destroy the engineering compound and the Protector plans.",	"m25o":"",	"m25s":"Thank you! Facing an improved Protector droid would not have been fun, to say the least. You are progessing well!",	"m25t":"Smash the Protector droids",	"number_of_entries":"25"
