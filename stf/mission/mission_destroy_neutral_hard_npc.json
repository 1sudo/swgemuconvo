		"m1d":"A major Black Sun glitterstim lab, responsible for supplying the dealers of several systems, has been located by Imperial Intelligence. These crooks are so well-connected, however, that any signs of an organized attack by either law enforcement or the Imperial Military would scatter them throughout the sector. We need to insure this facility is hit hard and put out of commission for good. A select team of highly skilled independent agents ought to be able to take this refinery out. It will be heavily guarded and anyone succeeding will likely earn the emnity of Black Sun, but removing the lab would be a huge step in eliminating glitterstim dealing in this sector. Naturally you'll be generously rewarded for your time and efforts. Do you accept?",	"m1o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m1s":"Bravo, agent! Your results never cease to impress us. We're glad to employ an agent as effective as you.",	"m1t":"Destroy glitterstim lab",	"m2d":"We've located the hideout of a local branch of the notorious swoop gang, the Shadow Angels of Dathomir. These creeps move fast once word reaches them that the authorities are on their way. This is a job for a small group of skilled and dedicated agents. The right strike team can blast this hideout and all of those vicious criminals to pieces before they had a chance to even look around. We'll pay a handsome reward for the successful completion of the mission. These gangsters are tough customers, though, so the agents who accept this mission should be highly trained and experienced in dealing with these types of situations. The coordinates will be sent upon the acceptance of the mission. Can we count on you?",	"m2o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m2s":"These gangs are always braver in packs and even then they can't put up a good fight when confronted with talent like yours? Job well done, agent. That reward is going to the right individual.",	"m2t":"Destroy swoop gang's hideout",	"m3d":"Jabba's swoopers think they can move into any system they like and stake their claim, regardless of what other hard-working criminals are already in the area? Not while I have something to say about it. Big Gizz is wanting to expand his organization beyond Mos Eisley at the expense of my interests. I need a hardy band of skilled assassins to show these new \"branches\" of that cretin's gang that the galaxy is a dangerous and treacherous place. I transmit the coordinates to the gang's new hideout when you accept, and I pay a very generous reward when they're gone. Sound like a deal?  ",	"m3o":"Lady Valarian",	"m3s":"Chew on that, Big Gizz! Way to go, killer. Jabba will soon learn your name. That may be good or bad depending on how spicy you like life to get. Here's your money. Don't spend it all in one joint.",	"m3t":"Take on Jabba's swoop gang",	"m4d":"An illegal weapons manufacturing facility has been located by Intelligence. We believe it may be run by Black Sun. Many of the weapons bought and sold by gunrunners come from facilities just like this one. We need an experienced strike team to go in there and blast that installation into so much space debris. If you've worked for us before, you'll know that our rewards are very generous but we expect results. These creeps will be well-armed, if nothing else, and will also likely be some of the best muscle Black Sun has to offer. Can you help us close this case?",	"m4o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m4s":"Wonderful! Less deadly weapons in the hands of criminals means less risk for our law enforcement agents. We need more agents like you.",	"m4t":"Destroy weapons making facility",	"m5d":"The vicious group of criminals behind one of Black Sun's major protection rackets has been discovered by Intelligence. They apparently operate out of a fairly well-guarded stronghold and fear nothing short of a full Imperial Military strike. They'd get away long before such a strike could be organized and executed, however, so we would rather hire a small but experienced strike team to take care of those rogues for us. We believe that this group answers to Vigo Green, but cannot verify that information as of this date. We'll transmit the coordinates to the team leader that accepts this mission. Our standard reward for this type of mission is in the offering as well. Do you think you can tackle this operation?",	"m5o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m5s":"Excellent work, agent. This victory will make life easier for hundreds of merchants in this sector. Always a pleasure to work with a professional like yourself.",	"m5t":"Take out protection racket",	"m6d":"Black Sun maintains several medical facilities that are open to any of their operatives. You can imagine how hard it would be for assassins, gangsters, and other criminals to get medical attention at their local clinics after a battle with local authorities. These facilities were created to answer that particular dilemma. We've located one of these centers and need it removed. We cannot afford to let these criminals patch themselves up after a scrape with our agents. These facilities are also used for major procedures like face reconstruction, to hide the identity of various underworld agents, and it's even suspected that some contain cloning technology. We need someone to gather a small strike team of experienced agents to hit this installation. The standard rewards will be offered for this type of work. Do you think you can undertake this mission? ",	"m6o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m6s":"Good work. The last thing we need are clones of infamous criminals running around causing havoc. Great way for crime lords to create the appearance of being \"untouchable.\" You've earned this reward, my friend.",	"m6t":"Take out criminal hospital",	"m7d":"Intelligence has managed to pinpoint the location of one of Jabba's major munitions depots. These weapons supply gunrunners in this and several adjoining sectors. Jabba's spies are scattered throughout our organization, however, and we suspect that any communiques between us and the Imperial Navy would be intercepted and transmitted to Jabba's people. That would give those thugs plenty of opportunity to vacate the premises. Stealth is important so we need a small team of agents to infiltrate that depot and blow it to bits. It will be very well defended as Jabba makes quite a bit of money off his gunrunning operations. We'll reward a job well done, of course. Are you the agent we're looking for? ",	"m7o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m7s":"You certainly are fearless, aren't you? You've gained a powerful enemy, we fear, but also a very influential friend. Congratulations on your success.",	"m7t":"Wipe out Jabba's munitions depot",	"m8d":"One of Black Sun's cadre of assassins has converted an abandoned mining installation into a stronghold specializing in training future killers. We can't afford to let this assassin academy continue to operate. We're offering a substantial reward to the strike team that can pull this off. Attacking a facility like this is no small matter. Some of the galaxy's deadliest guns are to be found there, not to mention state-of-the-art defenses. However, if you want to make a name for yourself, then wiping this installation out offers a great opportunity to do so. You feel like making history, agent?",	"m8o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m8s":"Now that was something. You should be working for Imperial Intelligence's Burea of Operations, agent. Excellent job. You've definitely earned this reward. ",	"m8t":"Take out assassin's HQ",	"m9d":"Some incredibly shortsighted former members of my organization have decided that they've \"outgrown\" me. As if refining high quality glitterstim spice was child's play and a career anyone could just jump into. Where do these thugs get their ideas? We need a specialized team of agents to help us teach these misguided rogues a serious lesson. The refining facility must be blown to atoms, and everyone inside must be vaporized. This is the lesson we must teach. Black Sun always makes things \"worth someone's time\" so do not worry on that account. Do you wish to get into our good graces?",	"m9o":"Black Sun: Vigo Clezo",	"m9s":"It's operatives like you that allow a businessman like myself to sleep peacefully at night. Bravo. The reward and my gratitude are yours.",	"m9t":"Take out spice refiners",	"m10d":"The Illustrious Jabba wishes to employ a small team of dedicated killers to help him teach a rival an important lesson in courtesy. Mighty Jabba does not consider it courteous for said rival to make attacks on his swoopers, regardless of where they choose to go. My lord's interests are wherever he chooses to put them and in all cases Jabba's claims to a region should always take precedence. Now Jabba requires that one of his rival's strongholds be obliterated, along with everyone inside. If you consider yourself the type of agent Jabba prizes most, fearless and inventive, then you should accept this mission and endeavor to please the powerful Jabba. His generosity extends beyond the money you'll receive for the completion of this mission. What is your answer?",	"m10o":"Bib Fortuna",	"m10s":"Jabba is pleased with your results. The mone is yours. Seek us out again in the future.",	"m10t":"Destroy one of Valarian's strongholds",	"m11d":"A foolish Vigo's sublieutenant involved with our profitable glitterstim trade has been skimming credits off the top of all our distribution. I'm not sure exactly why they thought we wouldn't notice. Needless to say, this matter must be redressed immediately. We don't want to risk an open war with the other Vigos so this situation must be handled by independent operatives and it must be made to look like a hit by pirates trying to make off with shipments of spice. The reward will be more than adequate for this job but will only come if the sublieutenant's stronghold is completely obliterated. This scum is tough so whoever accepts better go in blasting. We'll transmit coordinates when we have your acceptance.",	"m11o":"Black Sun: Vigo Perit",	"m11s":"Results we can see will always lead to bigger and better assignments. Good work, agent. You may have a future with Black Sun. Perhaps even rise to the level of Vigo yourself.",	"m11t":"Take out cheating spice dealer",	"m12d":"Independent thought is wasted on assassins. First, they get used to everybody doing what they say. Then they fall victim to the lure of millions of credits passing through their hands. Next thing you know, they think they can run the operation better than their superiors. They get these warped visions of bumping off the boss and lots of smiles and handshaking and pats on the back... The job of a Vigo is not an easy one, my friend.   We need some skilled assassins to take out some skilled assassins. Unlike your targets, we hope that you and your team know your place in the universe and accept it. Last thing we need is more killers who think they should be running things. A substantial reward awaits the successful removal of these upstarts. You accept the mission and we'll tell you where you and your team need to go. We hope you won't mess this up. We've had too much of that recently in our organization.",	"m12o":"Black Sun: Vigo Durga",	"m12s":"Well handled. You and your team are glowing examples of what hired killers should be: obedient and efficient. Claim your reward.",	"m12t":"Hit the hitmen",	"m13d":"These pirates are almost as bad as those hotshot smugglers. If any of these rogues get the tiniest drop of notoriety, it goes straight to their heads. Suddenly they think they can set their own rules, do whatever they like, and ignore their benefactors. The result is nothing but headaches and work for us, but it also means good fortune for independent agents like yourself. We need a pirate band taken down. They've become too much of a liability for our organization and must now be squashed. A small elite team of troubleshooters ought to be able to take care of this situation with little trouble. If you've worked for us before, you know our pay is quite generous. If this is your first time, then prepare to be pleased when all this mess is settled. We'll send the coordinates to the pirate's lair upon receiving your acceptance.",	"m13o":"Black Sun",	"m13s":"Excellently done, agent. Your resourcefulness is most inspirational - a shining example to hired guns throughout the galaxy. Enjoy your lucre.",	"m13t":"Remove the thorn",	"m14d":"When pirates are hired to perform a job, they should stick to it regardless of the consequences. What's happening to professionalism in our circles? A renegade band of pirates has decided that they can keep the credits given to them for the performance of certain duties regardless of whether those duties were adequately performed or not. It is my responsibility to teach these slugs a lesson. I'm offering a reward to the team of hired killers that can infiltrate this band's base and blast it (and them) to pieces. If you accept, you'll be told where to go. These pirates are not likely to go down without a fight, so I'd blast first and ask questions later if I were you. Do you think you could take care of this problem for me?",	"m14o":"Black Sun: Vigo Clezo",	"m14s":"Good to see that some scum still care about professionalism. Good for you. Come look me up again when you need more work.",	"m14t":"Help clean out the pirate gene pool",	"m15d":"I've yet to meet someone who got into trouble by sticking to doing what they do best. It's only when a few malcontents, not happy with the status quo, try to do something different that we get problems. Or at least I do. Pirates aren't freedom fighters, right? You know that, I know that, everyone knows that. Pirates are thieves and murderers. That's what they do. And that's exactly what I need a small team of hired guns to explain to some former associates who've got it in their heads to help the Rebellion. Not on my watch. These scum think they can wipe their past clean by helping some moisture-farmers-turned-Rebels get themselves slaughtered by stormtroopers? Their case of sudden conscience is costing me too much money. Accept the job and I'll tell you where you need to go. Leave no walls standing. I want to make sure this conscience-acquiring is not contagious.",	"m15o":"Black Sun: Vigo Green",	"m15s":"Finally, someone who knows what they're good at and stick to it. A long, happy life will likely be yours, friend. Come see me again soon.",	"m15t":"Destroy pirates with a case of conscience",	"m16d":"One of the galaxy's most notorious and bloodthirsty band of pirates has fallen for our trap. They took some bait we offered and raided a ship full of tainted cargo. We planted undetectable homing beacons inside that cargo and now the pirates have led us right back to their lair. Their base sensors are rather sophisticated, however, so they would detect the approach of Imperial cruisers and escape into space before we could strike. We need a team of highly skilled and experienced agents to land near their base and take it out. The pirates would not react to the arrival of a standard transport as they're used to monitoring that sort of activity in their system. Are you the sort of operative that could assemble such a strike team? The Empire is counting on you, citizen. ",	"m16o":"Imperial Navy",	"m16s":"An excellent strike. The Empire is indebted to you, agent. Perhaps you should contact us about helping to crush the Rebellion. We could use agents like you.",	"m16t":"Smash the notorious pirates",	"m17d":"Normally I wouldn't care about the activities of pirates but these particular ones happened to strike a slaver ship on its way to deliver a shipment of Twi'lek exotic dancers to me. Even after the pirates discovered who this shipment was intended for, they still decided to sell the slaves on their own and keep all the profits. This matter must be resolved. I cannot allow pirates to seize what I have rightfully stolen - if word of this spreads it could weaken my position with Jabba. I therefore have need of a team of deadly killers to rid me of this embarrassment. One of the Twi'lek girls had a homing chip implanted in her thigh (a special gift intended for one of Jabba's rivals) which has allowed me to discover where these slugs are hiding. Accept the mission and the coordinates are yours. Leave no witnesses and burn their lair to the ground.",	"m17o":"Bib Fortuna",	"m17s":"Well done. Accept this reward and look me up again soon.",	"m17t":"Blast the errant pirates",	"m18d":"Jabba claims he doesn't want a war and then arranges for pirates to hit ships carrying goods intended for me. If that gargantuan worm thinks I can't see who's behind these recent attacks, he's as stupid as he looks. As much as I know that Jabba is baiting me, I must respond or I risk other pirates trying their hands at plucking my cargo. This mission won't be easy but it will pay very well. Jabba is known to employ the most ruthless and dangerous pirates in the trade. But a resourceful team of agents, skilled in teamwork and deadly with their blasters, should be able to pull it off. You fancy yourself such an individual? If you think so I'll send you the coordinates to the pirates' lair. ",	"m18o":"Lady Valarian",	"m18s":"I had a hunch about you. You seemed to be the type to get results. Congratulations on a job well done. Enjoy the reward.",	"m18t":"Swat Jabba's pirates",	"m19d":"Mighty Jabba's wrath is a powerful and dreadful thing to incur - few rational beings wish to risk it. This band of pirates, it seems, do not share that particular rationality. They have been raiding my lord's spice shipments with impunity and this must stop. My lord was wise enough to have planted a spy in their midst months ago, suspecting that this particular band might try to double-cross him in the future. Thanks to my lord's wisdom, we know the location of this band's hidden base. Illustrious Jabba wishes me to hire the best assassins credits can buy and instruct them to practice their trade on these foolish rogues. Do you wish to take advantage of this opportunity to earn both my lord's favor and a substantial reward? ",	"m19o":"Bib Fortuna",	"m19s":"Most effective. You serve my master well and you will be rewarded.",	"m19t":"Help a Hutt make a point",	"m20d":"One of the major areas of concern for the Corporate Sector Authority is piracy. Our ships in particular draw those predators like skettos to a sleeping dewback. Recently we've discovered that many of these pirates have banded together to form some sort of \"Brotherhood.\" By sharing information about transport movements, safe spaceports, and Imperial activity, these rogues can insure a higher rate of success for their comrades. We've used our resources, mostly in the form of bribes, to pinpoint the locations of some of the busiest spaceports used by this Brotherhood. We offer a substantial reward to anyone who can make sure these ports are knocked out of commission. There's plenty of work doing that as these criminals have dozens of these havens. Coordinates will be transmitted upon your acceptance. ",	"m20o":"The Corporate Sector Authority",	"m20s":"Good work. Remember there's plenty more of those havens out there. We'll continue to pay as long as you continue to produce results.",	"m20t":"Wipe out the pirates' haven",	"m21d":"Every successful businessman deserves a luxurious retirement.  No one is denying that.  But a player is expected to settle all bets before cashing out of the game.  That is where a certain ex-employee of mine has failed.  He was one of the most successful pirates on my payroll.  A prolific provider for many standard years.  He retired with my personal blessing.  Unfortunately I have learned that he hid an old debt from me, and has rebuked my requests for payment.  I have extended every courtesy to him, but the time has now come to finalize negotiations.  I require a crack team of assassins to hit him hard and leave no one standing.  Only the deadliest killers need apply.  He knows I'm coming, so he has fortified himself in a stronghold and gathered a small army of the toughest scum in the sector.  Tear the place to the ground and you shall be very well compensated.  Contact me for his coordinates.",	"m21o":"Black Sun: Vigo Green",	"m21s":"Very well done.  Have I hired you before?  You have the skill and the guts to be a player yourself.  You would make an excellent asset to my organization.",	"m21t":"Retire an ex-pirate for good",	"m22d":"They say lucre makes the galaxy spin and I have always found that to be true.  My various industrial enterprises have made me one of the most influential Neimoidians in nine sectors.  I have assets spanning a hundred systems.  When you attain such success, however, you become an attractive target for professional thieves.  I am no exception.  I have just discovered that one of my industrial villas has been overrun by several pirate crews.  Luckily a good businessman knows how to distribute resources to safeguard his investments.  I wish to disburse a very large sum of credits to a group of soldiers-of-fortune who have the means and the wherewithal to dislodge these slugs from my property.  Be warned: they are well-equipped and extremely dangerous.  I am paying for the best of the best, so don't waste my time if you're anything but elite.  Also, I shall shed no tears if the villa itself sustains heavy damage, as I intend to collect an insurance disbursement and shut the place down anyway.",	"m22o":"An Influential Neimoidian",	"m22s":"Your work was sloppy in one or two particulars, but you did complete the task at hand.  Good job leveling the villa.  Do enjoy this payment.",	"m22t":"Dislodge pirates from my industrial villa",	"m23d":"Oh, can't someone please help us?  My family rules a small but beautiful planet in Xappyh Sector.  Long ago we built an outpost to tend the needs of the poor and downtrodden in nearby systems.  But calamity befell us when our outpost was captured by the crew of a large and terribly frightening pirate frigate.  We would like to remove them so that we can resume helping the needy of the galaxy; but the regional governor has refused to lend us aid.  We are a peaceful planet and have no weapons.  We do have money, though, with which we shall gladly part if it means we can have our outpost back.  Are there no stalwart heroes left in the universe who will come to us in our hour of need?  These pirates are a cruel and awful lot and we are frightened that they might do harm to the poverty-stricken areas near them.  Money is no object.  Please, just help us!",	"m23o":"A Desperate Princess",	"m23s":"You did it!  It's a shame about the outpost being destroyed, but I just know that you did your best to protect it.  Please, take your reward and know that you are always welcome on my planet, where I will treat you to every pleasure my humble palace can provide.",	"m23t":"Help us in our hour of need",	"m24d":"Mighty Jabba is always looking for new talent to add to his organization.  After some recent personnel issues, he has decided that all new recruits must prove themselves in a practical demonstration of their skills.  Illustrious Jabba wishes me to provide one such audition for a hit team.  To warrant their abilities, these assassins will be required to break into the landing bay of an especially lethal pirate captain and blast the entire facility into its component atoms.  Upon the completion of this task I shall present a report to the Invincible Jabba, who will render a decision on the worthiness of the applicants.  Wise job seekers should be aware that I do not take my duties lightly.  Only the finest and most despicable assassins deserve my attention; others are highly discouraged from occupying my precious time.",	"m24o":"Bib Fortuna",	"m24s":"You have demonstrated no small amount of skill.

What they fail to recognize is that organizations like ours help forge those reputations - and we can destroy them just as easily.

We're about to prove them wrong. A substantial reward awaits the operatives who will drive this point home to this errant smuggler. If you're the type of killer we think you are, this should pose no problem for you. Do you want the job?",	"m25o":"Black Sun",	"m25s":"Congratulations. Those are results that make us proud. Stick with us and you'll go far. ",	"m25t":"Take out the errant smuggler",	"m26d":"No one cheats a Vigo of Black Sun, especially when that Vigo is Durga the Hutt. Apparently this simple truism has escaped a certain band of smugglers formerly working for the illustrious Vigo on Nar Shaddaa.

Vigo Durga will pay a handsome reward to anyone who can send these smugglers back to their makers. These are the coordinates to the smugglers' hideout. Make sure there are no survivors and no witnesses. Can Black Sun rely on your cooperation and discretion?",	"m26o":"Black Sun: Vigo Durga",	"m26s":"Most excellently done. Vigo Durga sends his congratulations and asks that you contact us again in the future. Enjoy your reward.",	"m26t":"Remove a band of smugglers",	"m27d":"Spice smugglers can be so untrustworthy. A recent shipment of spice came up dreadfully short. Unfortunately this shipment was under Vigo Clezo's supervision, which made him look bad in the eyes of the rest of Black Sun.

The base is to be obliterated and every courier is to be eliminated. We do hope this is very clear. The Empire really should know better than to try and infiltrate our organization with these sorts of agents. It always leads to a tragic loss of life and talent.

It's not enough that the loathsome pirate, Han Solo, has evaded my master's attempts to capture him, but now it seems another band of smugglers have been inspired by Solo's actions to defy the powerful Jabba. For reasons of his own, His Exaltedness has decided not to approach the Bounty Hunters' Guild with this matter (given their recent troubles) but has instead decided to find some enterprising free agents to settle things.
