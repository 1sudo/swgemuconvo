		"m1d":"Local Imperial patrols have been relying on a refueling depot not far from here. The depot's destruction would certainly hamper the Empire's ability to effectively search for our cells. The Empire realizes this, so the depot is likely to be well defended. This mission will require skill and fortitude. Can the Alliance depend on you to lead such a strike?",	"m1o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m1s":"Now that's how it's done! Those Imperial patrols will stay grounded for a while. Long live the Alliance!",	"m1t":"Local Rebel Refueling Depot",	"m2d":"A transport repair station at these coordinates services Imperial scout troopers' speeder bikes. If this facility were destroyed, it would limit the number of Imperial search-and-destroy missions for this entire system. Can we count on you to orchestrate this strike? As always, the Alliance will reward you for services rendered.",	"m2o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m2s":"Broken down speeder bikes don't do the Empire any good. Job well done, agent. The Alliance could use more fighters like you.",	"m2t":"Local Rebel Repair Station",	"m3d":"A small SoroSuub weapons testing facility must be knocked out. We believe they are working on an improved design for the scout trooper blaster that would greatly increase its firepower and accuracy. The Alliance can't afford to have scout troopers get better sidearms. We don't know what kind of security this facility will have, but we imagine it'll be formidable. You might need help.",	"m3o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m3s":"Bravo! No new blasters for those scout troopers! An impressive bit of work, agent. The Alliance thrives because of individuals like you. May the Force be with you.",	"m3t":"Weapons Development Lab",	"m4d":"We've located a major Imperial power droid manufacturing plant. Taking this plant out would be more than a simple inconvenience for the Empire. Their Star Destroyers and garrisons rely on these power droids to keep battle stations running. It will take a strong, precise strike to cripple this installation. The Alliance needs your help.  ",	"m4o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m4s":"No power means no weapons or defenses. Our congratulations on the success of your mission. Keep up the good work. The Alliance is counting on you.",	"m4t":"Power Droid Plant",	"m5d":"Our informants have identified an ISB compound used for interrogations. If the stories can be believed, terrible atrocities have taken place. Destroying this foul place would send the right message to both the Empire and to citizens who lived in fear of Imperial Security. We're looking for a dedicated agent who can lead a successful assault on this nightmarish compound. Are you that agent? ",	"m5o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m5s":"Bravo, agent! Now citizens will realize that the power of the ISB is not absolute and that the Empire is fallible. You've earned your reward.",	"m5t":"ISB Interrogation Compound",	"m6d":"We've located a Sienar Fleet Systems warehouse and have learned that it's currently storing ion engines scheduled to go to Imperial shipyards in this sector. That will mean more TIE fighters for our X-wing pilots to deal with. We need someone to destroy that warehouse and everything inside.",	"m6o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m6s":"The distinctive roar of those TIE engines is greatly diminished today. Great job, agent. We knew we could count on you.",	"m6t":"Sienar Warehouse",	"m7d":"An Imperial Academy processing center is currently housing the results of several hundred potential pilots' flight exams. If those scores are destroyed, this will create a severe backlog for the Imperial bureaucracy and slow the aggressive recruitment efforts of the Imperial Navy. Further, it would let us approach potential recruits and possibly enlist their aid against the Empire. Do you wish to lead this important mission?",	"m7o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m7s":"Excellent! The best thing about the Empire's ponderous bureaucracy is that it's easy to throw a hydrospanner into the works. Good job! Claim your reward and may the Force be with you.",	"m7t":"Imperial Records",	"m8d":"The Alliance has acquired the coordinates to an Imperial HoloNet data collection station. This station is used by Imperial Intelligence's Analysis Bureau to coordinate surveillance efforts for the entire sector. If we take out this station, we effectively cripple Imperial Intelligence's ability to uncover our sabotage missions and raids of Imperial depots. This would be a great victory for the Alliance. Can you lead such a strike?",	"m8o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m8s":"Bravo! Cut off the head and the body cannot survive for long. Your efforts to interrupt Imperial Intelligence's communication to the rest of the Empire's war machine will be instrumental in our eventual success. Your reward is well earned.",	"m8t":"HoloNet Data Station",	"m9d":"An small Imperial outpost is currently being used to store of seized glitterstim spice. This cargo is intended to bribe Corporate Sector Authority officials to comply with Imperial Intelligence's requests to access confidential corporate records. The Alliance needs a few good individuals to make sure that outpost is destroyed and everything inside it is burned to the ground. No spice, no favors from the CSA. The outpost will be well guarded. After all, there's a whole lot of spice in there. ",	"m9o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m9s":"Good! Not only have you disposed of a great deal of illegal drugs, you've cost Imperial Intelligence millions of credits worth of bribe money. Let's see how eager they are to bribe the CSA now that they have to dig into their own budget. This is a great victory for the Alliance, friend.",	"m9t":"Illegal Drugs",	"m10d":"A cargo of probe droids has just been delivered to a supply depot servicing this sector. A Star Destroyer is scheduled to enter the system's orbit sometime in the next few days and those probe droids will be transported aboard. We don't need to tell you how much damage those probe droids can cause to the Alliance. We need a skilled agent to take out that supply depot and make sure those probe droids are destroyed.",	"m10o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m10s":"Good going! Fewer probe droids means fewer chances to find our bases. The Empire can't destroy what they can't find, after all. You're becoming a very promising agent indeed.",	"m10t":"Poke Out the Empire's Eyes",	"m11d":"We've discovered a shipment of turbolaser actuators, currently stored in an Imperial depot and scheduled to be delivered to the Kuat Drive Yards. We must make sure those actuators are never installed in any capital ship's weapons. A team of skilled agents should be able to blast this depot off without much trouble. You'll have to work fast, though.",	"m11o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m11s":"Well struck, agent. Without their turbolasers, those hulking capital ships are just so much space debris. May the Force be with you.",	"m11t":"Turbolaser Actuators",	"m12d":"A large shipment of orbital mines is to be delivered to the Star Destroyer Avenger soon. The dispersal of these mines would make life much more difficult for our fleet, as you can imagine. We've discovered these mines and need the depot blasted into oblivion. The coordinates will be sent when you accept the mission. May the Force be with you. ",	"m12o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m12s":"Good work, citizen! Those mines won't be claiming the lives of our pilots and crew members. We look forward to working with you again.",	"m12t":"Orbital Mines",	"m13d":"The Empire has designed an improved subspace transceiver. The working prototype was sent to a manufacturing facility for mass production. A small team of operatives must make sure those transceivers are never built and either secure or destroy the prototype. We'll transmit the coordinates when we have your acceptance.",	"m13o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m13s":"It's obvious you know the meaning of success, citizen. Job well done! Even if we didn't get the prototype, its destruction is a good consolation prize.",	"m13t":"Imperial Transceivers",	"m14d":"Reports have been coming in about that amazing little MSE-6 droid. If Imperial Intelligence reports are to be believed, that tiny dynamo has blasted its way past blockades, commandeered vessels, and led those Imperial slugs on a wild mynock chase. All this paints a very amusing picture of the Empire's overall effectiveness. We want to help spread these rumors. We've planted a false Imperial report on the HoloNet that claims the Empire has captured the small troublemaker, which is being held at a detention facility awaiting interrogation by Imperial Inquisitors. We need a team of operatives to strike this detention facility and make it seem as if the MSE-6 droid was \"rescued\" by the Alliance. Can you help us embarrass the Empire further?",	"m14o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m14s":"Excellent \"rescue!\" If we can get those Imperial slugs to start worrying about their MSE-6 droids, then we've already won this war. Keep it up.",	"m14t":"Rescue Mouse Droid",	"m15d":"The Empire has deployed a prefab structure in an outlying area. It appears to be an early beachhead for a diplomatic garrison. No one here knows what a diplomat would have to be diplomatic about, way out there. In any case, it is essential to destroy it before the Empire can fortify it.",	"m15o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m15s":"Fast work! It's not often we take out an Imperial garrison, even if it is just a diplomatic garrison. Actually, only the first part of one. Never mind, you deserve your reward!",	"m15t":"Imperial Diplomatic Garrison",	"m16d":"We have identified an Imperial fortified complex as a gunnery school for local recruits. Today they're firing at target droids, but tomorrow they'll be aiming at us. You have to destroy that compound -- today!",	"m16o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m16s":"Excellent work! The Alliance has nothing against education, but we don't like what the Empire does with it. We look forward to working with you again!",	"m16t":"Empire Gunnery School",	"m17d":"The Empire's infrared camera lenses require the rare mineral byrothsis. These lenses require frequent specialized maintenance, and one of the maintenance facilities is nearby. By destroying the byrothsis purification facility, your team can put the Empire in the dark. Good luck!",	"m17o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m17s":"Excellent job. With their infrared lenses going cloudy, Imperial TIE fighters might be slower to see our ships. Let's hope!",	"m17t":"Byrothsis Purification Facility",	"m18d":"The Empire is relaying a cache of rare durindfire gems, under heavy guard, to a merchant in this area. You may know that Imperials traffic in these gems to finance their more exotic projects, such as the Death Star. If you can destroy these gems in their holding facility, you'll strike a blow against covert financiers across the galaxy.",	"m18o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m18s":"Durindfire gems flash brilliantly, but in Imperial hands they're covered with blood. It's better that you destroyed them. Good work!",	"m18t":"Durindfire Gem Holding Facility",	"m19d":"Imperial forces are guarding -- perhaps a better word is \"confining\" -- engineers working for Baktoid Combat Automata. In this compound these engineers are stress-testing blaster subsystems for a redesigned Protector-series combat droid. Destroy the engineering compound and the Protector plans.",	"m19o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m19s":"Thank you! Facing an improved Protector droid would not have been fun, to say the least. You are progessing well!",	"m19t":"Protector Droid Engineering Compound",	"m20d":"To get what it wants, the Empire has made plenty of covert deals with criminals. Right now it wants money, and so it's shipping thermal detonators to local gangsters. Whether they're set off by Imperials or crooks, these bombs always end up destroying innocent citizens' property. If you can blow up the detonator warehouse, and its heavy defenses, you'll be doing this planet a big favor.",	"m20o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m20s":"You did it! It's a relief to know those detonators won't be troubling the locals. The reward's yours!",	"m20t":"Thermal Detonator Warehouse",	"m21d":"If it scares you to think of a harmless protocol droid stabbing you in your sleep, listen to this. Imperial Intelligence is working on high-frequency broadcasts that burn out a droid's restraining bolts and ruin its programming. Basically a droid gets this signal and goes berserk. Of course, any grownup can handle a rogue 3PO unit, but what about the children? Stop this weird-science research before it's too late.",	"m21o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m21s":"Scratch one more Imperial Intelligence mad-science project. That droid idea might never have worked, but it doesn't hurt that you made sure. Thanks!",	"m21t":"Restraining Bolt Sabotage Project",	"m22d":"If you've fought on foot against one of those two-leg Imperial scout walkers, you know they're dangerous. We've got word that a local armory is stockpiling the specialized axidite control boxes used in AT-ST command pods. You have a big chance here to interrupt a major Imperial supply chain!",	"m22o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m22s":"Thank you! That armory stockpile would have gone into dozens of Imperial walkers. Maybe hundreds. Good job!",	"m22t":"Imperial Axidite Supplies",	"m23d":"You've heard of the dola trees, the sentient plants of Aruza? No? Their flowers make an antibiotic syrup we use to treat local ailments. We negotiated with the dola for a supply of flowers, but Imperial Intelligence agents stole them and plan to use them to breed a new slave race of dola trees. The flowers are now useless for antibiotics. Destroy them and the Imperial research lab, and stop the plot against the dola trees!",	"m23o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m23s":"The dola syrup stolen by the Empire would have saved lives, but your work at least protects the dola trees from Imperial slavery. Thank you!",	"m23t":"Dola Antibiotic Research",	"m24d":"Informants tell us the Empire is shipping in components for their GTU AV-1A Assault Armor. It's a powered combat suit for elite troops, sort of a hovertank you can wear. We've never seen it in action, and we don't want to. If you inflict enough damage to the warehouse, you may set off the explosive charges they use for the suit's ejection system. Then get clear, fast!",	"m24o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m24s":"Nice job! We hope the Empire will reconsider their GTU deployment in this region.",	"m24t":"GTU Powered Armor Components",	"m25d":"An Imperial Security outpost here has procured, through illegal back-channels, a shipment of neuronic whips. That's right, slaver weapons, outlawed on every civilized world. They intend to use these brutal stun-whips for crowd control and intimidation. You must destroy the warehouse and the whips. Expect serious opposition, though.",	"m25o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m25s":"What a relief! Those neuronic whips would have caused terror far beyond mere crowd control. You're building a good reputation.",	"m25t":"Neuronic Whips",	"m26d":"Maybe you've heard the reports of local swoop gangs with suspiciously good weaponry. We know the Empire's COMPNOR security goons have been arming crooks in communities sympathetic to the Alliance. Now we've found an Imperial Army depot where COMPNOR requisitions the gang weapons. Stop this operation at its source!",	"m26o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m26s":"That's one more blow in the fight against gang violence. Good work! We're delighted that you're showing such promise.",	"m26t":"Army Weapons Going to Swoop Gangs",	"m27d":"We've located an Imperial Army installation housing unusual ammunition: flechette microdart canisters, toxin darts, magna caster quarrels. The installation doubles as quarters for the specialists who maintain this ammo. Expect tough opposition, and stay well clear when you blow up the place.",	"m27o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m27s":"Well done! It's enough trouble facing blasters and AT-ATs without worrying about those deadly exotics. Your star is on the rise here!",	"m27t":"Imperial Exotic Ammunition",	"m28d":"The Empire's covert research into planet-wide biochemical weaponry continues. Mass production of these fearsome killers require specialized reagents and catalysts. We have tracked down a facility producing purified niobarium, a poisonous chemical used in one weapons-grade process. To cut off that process, destroy the niobarium plant.",	"m28o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m28s":"Reports are showing negligible release of niobarium from the destruction. Fine job! Please contact us again for new assignments.",	"m28t":"Niobarium Reagent Facility",	"m29d":"DX-343 is an industrial solvent that, on exposure into air, disperses into mist. The DX mist disrupts electronic equipment and makes breathing difficult. If our reports are correct, the Empire has stockpiled enough DX-343 at the following coordinates to wipe out three hangars of starfighters and their pilots. Destroy it!",	"m29o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m29s":"If the Empire had used all that DX-343, we would have been carrying starships out of the hangar in pieces, and their pilots too. Good job taking it out! Please accept our thanks.",	"m29t":"DX-343 Solvent Stockpile",	"m30d":"Production of hyperbaride, which is used for casings of heavy turbolasers, generates highly poisonous byproducts. The Empire usually dumps this stuff on airless moons or into stars, but we've learned of a new cache in this area. We don't know of any current hyperbaride production, so we suspect they're stockpiling this poison as a weapon. The cache is well guarded, but we want it destroyed, preferably in a ball of sterilizing flame.",	"m30o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m30s":"That's great news! We've had no reports of escape of toxic gases from the site, either. So you've come through for us well, and we'll remember it. Thanks!",	"m30t":"Hyperbaride Dump -- Biochem Weapon?",	"m31d":"Get this: An Imperial mess facility got accidentally infested with Sorderian weft-worms. We assume the worms were parasites inside a slave who ducked the Empire's sterilization routines. This would only help us, except that the Empire has decided to solve the infestation by blowing up the entire facility from orbit. Their aim in these matters is not flawless, so we'd actually like you to destroy the facility first. Target practice from a Star Destroyer -- we don't need that!",	"m31o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m31s":"Great, now we're doing the Imperials' work for them. What a galaxy! But thank you, and be glad we no longer have to fear those oh-so-terrible weft-worms.",	"m31t":"Infestation of Imperial Kitchen Facility",	"m32d":"The astrogation computers on Imperial starships rely on starfield data collected by countless space probes. Probe data for a given planetary neighborhood is collated and encoded at a central astrogation station for relay to Coruscant. If you destroy the astrogation facilities at these coordinates, the Empire must rely on outdated information when travelling in this system. But beware, these stations are always guarded!",	"m32o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m32s":"Great job! Now we'll hope an Imperial ship runs into a meteor shower or asteroid field it couldn't predict. We admire your growing reputation.",	"m32t":"Imperial Astrogation Station",	"m33d":"The most sophisticated communication relays in the galaxy, outside Coruscant, sit aboard Imperial capital ships. Our agents within the Imperial bureaucracy have redirected a shipment of these delicate relays, worth a fortune to the Empire, to a supply station here. Though this is hardly a soft target, it's our best chance to destroy a vital component of the Imperial comm apparatus. Move quickly!",	"m33o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m33s":"This is fine news! We must hope that the Empire's capital ships, with hampered communications, will operate based on inferior strategy. Please check back with us, for we are pleased at your progress!",	"m33t":"Starship Communication Relays",	"m34d":"Informants have brought us dramatic news. Empire ship designer Lira Wessex, who created the original schematics for the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, is apparently visiting this world on a sectorwide tour of shipbuilding facilities.

Strike fast and strike hard!",	"m34o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m34s":"Great work! If Lira Wessex was inside that wreck, then you've brought a long, bad career to a belated close. Thank you, and contact us again soon!",	"m34t":"Lira Wessex Blights Local Region",	"m35d":"The SoroSuub Corporation, once a peaceful contributor to the economy of the Old Republic, is now a dangerous ally of the Empire. Their ships and weapons are responsible for the deaths of untold numbers of Alliance fighters. To isolate them from distribution contractors, we have begun a campaign to harry shipments of SoroSuub armaments across the galaxy. Here are coordinates for a distribution center on this world. Be aware that the Empire knows of our strategy and often deploys troops to protect these shipments. Prepare for well-armed resistance.",	"m35o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m35s":"Allies of the Empire are enemies of freedom. You have done well. Contact us again for the coordinates of more SoroSuub distribution centers.",	"m35t":"SoroSuub Corporation Shipments",	"m36d":"The Empire cherishes every opportunity to capture an intact X-wing fighter. InCom's superior X-wing technology, with its heavy armor and hyperdrive, is the envy of the Imperial Navy. To our dismay, recently a civilian informant tipped the Imperial Security Bureau to the location of a hidden cache of fighters. Stormtroopers descended on the place, and now five pristine X-wings are being readied for transport to the Empire's cronies at Sienar Fleet Systems. We cannot allow these ships to depart their landing bay. We need agents in the area to hit the place fast. Make sure nothing is left but smoke and rubble.",	"m36o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m36s":"Well done. All five X-wing fighters were reduced to slag. We must guard every technological advantage if we are to bring the Empire to its knees.",	"m36t":"Captured X-wing Fighters",	"m37d":"The Alliance has placed agents inside many Imperial operations. These brave individuals risk their lives to bring us information concerning the Empire's movements. Sometimes we require direct action to ensure their continued secrecy. Currently one secret operative, well-placed in the Imperial system, is under suspicion by his supervisor. We cannot afford to lose him. Therefore we are commissioning a strike team to attack the small garrison where he is stationed. The diversion will let him eliminate his supervisor and destroy evidence. The action should be loud and messy to provide maximum distraction. Be well-armed and ready for a protracted fight.",	"m37o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m37s":"Well done. Thanks to your distraction, our secret agent was able to remove the officer who questioned his loyalty to the Empire.",	"m37t":"Assist Secret Agent",	"m38d":"An Imperial spy has infiltrated our supply network. We know only that he is a Kubaz and he is very good at his work. We have a credible suspicion that he has collected dangerous information about our secret shipping routes.

Otherwise many brave Alliance informants will assuredly lose their lives.",	"m39o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",	"m39s":"We have monitored transmissions within Imperial Intelligence.

The Alliance values capable agents like you. Contact us again soon.",	"m40t":"Destroy an Intelligence Office",	"m41d":"Cloaking devices create no end of difficulty for Alliance blockade runners. We have tracked a shipment of hybridium ore, essential to modern cloaking systems, from Garos IV to an Imperial transfer point.
