		"m1o":"My friend is now homeless due to debt. I promised a place to stay until things settle down. My friend can't afford fancy transports, as you might imagine. Could you provide safe escort?",	"m1p":"Thanks for coming to get me. Things are looking pretty bleak for me right now. At least I still have friends to help me out of this financial slump.",	"m1t":"A Friend in Need",	"m1c":"Thank you. You are indeed a noble citizen. Not too many folks care about their fellow beings these days. It gives me hope for the Empire.",	"m1e":"I appreciate your efforts on my behalf. I'll give you a piece of advice: Don't ever put all your credits on one podrace. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.",	"m2o":"My best friend flew in for my wedding but unfortunately landed at the wrong starport. Being an optimistic sort, my buddy decided to walk here, not realizing how far it was. Could you provide an escort?",	"m2p":"Hi. You must be here to make sure I get into town safely. Thanks for coming to get me. Things sure are far apart here, huh?",	"m2t":"Eager Wedding Guest",	"m2c":"Glad to see you made it safe and sound. It was very important to have my best friend at this wedding. This should demonstrate my gratitude.",	"m2e":"Much obliged, friend. I'll be sure to consult maps a little more closely next time I travel to another system.",	"m3o":"I recently lost my father in a tragic vaporator accident. His best friend just arrived for the funeral but, due to a miscommunication, has been stranded far from here. Could you safely escort my guest here?",	"m3p":"Blasted couriers! Never entrust an important message to a total stranger! You're a good friend of the family's, right?",	"m3t":"Lost Funeral Attendee",	"m3c":"Thanks so much. This means a lot to my family. Allow me to pay you for this valuable service.",	"m3e":"They entrusted my safety to a total stranger? What is this galaxy coming to? Maybe it's best my good friend left it when he did.",	"m4o":"An old friend of the family claims to have discovered some buried treasure out in the wilderness. I've received a transmission instructing me to hire an escort to help bring this treasure safely back. Can you help?",	"m4p":"Hope you're ready to defend me with your life, friend. If we're lucky, no one will suspect I know the whereabouts of precious treasure.",	"m4t":"Protect Lost Treasure",	"m4c":"Your help is much appreciated. Allow me to pay you for your trouble.",	"m4e":"Thanks, friend. You fancy flame opals? Then hit the local markets in a few weeks and you may find some beauties for sale. ",	"m5o":"My aged father is developing Bitter Winter disease. I need a specialist escorted here to attend to him. I'll pay you handsomely if you can bring me the specialist in one piece.",	"m5p":"Well, there's no time to waste. I assume you're my escort, yes? Good. Lead on.",	"m5t":"Bitter Winter Specialist",	"m5c":"Thank you ever so much. You've earned this reward, friend. Come, Doctor, my father awaits your inspection.",	"m5e":"Your courage is unusual for someone of your size. I hope you fare well in the future. Thanks for getting me here.",	"m6o":"A strange old hermit contacted me recently. This individual claims to be a friend of my late father and wants to present me with some sort of archaic weapon, something my father wanted me to have when I was old enough. Could you escort this hermit here?",	"m6p":"You have been chosen to act as my Imperial guard? Do you feel anger? Good! Take me to my young apprentice, minion, and be quick! ",	"m6t":"Provide an \"Imperial\" Escort",	"m6c":"Uh, this is the hermit? I think I've heard of this lunatic. Okay, here's your money. I have a feeling this will not end well for me.",	"m6e":"Excellent, minion! You have brought me safely to my destination. Now, apprentice, I shall see if you are ready to take your father's place at my side!",	"m7o":"A Zanazi teacher has agreed to join our community and help enlighten the locals. The teacher has just finished a purification ritual in the wilderness and now needs safe escort here. Can you do it?",	"m7p":"Let us begin our journey. This one will be short, unlike the journey we must all undertake to embrace the Cosmic Balance. Chant with me. Ehhhnh--",	"m7t":"Find the Enlightened One",	"m7c":"Thanks for delivering our teacher. This payment can only begin to express our appreciation. The path to Balance awaits us all! Ehhhnh--",	"m7e":"No, the sound is more nasal. Ehhhhnh. Try it again. Deeper breath. Oh, we're here? Remember, true enlightenment begins in your nose.",	"m8o":"I have a kind of, um, droid emergency here. I'd rather not go into the details, but the parts I need are custom-made by some specialist out in the wilderness. No, I don't know why. No, I'd prefer not to explain. I'll pay you to go there and bring the parts back here.",	"m8p":"Droid parts? For the problem your patron is having, there are no parts. There's just me. Please lead the way back.",	"m8t":"Droid Specialist",	"m8c":"If you must know, some slicer prankster secretly reprogrammed my droids. They barricaded themselves in my bedroom. Apparently this citizen can negotiate with them. Here's your fee. Please don't tell anyone about this.",	"m8e":"Here at last. I'll begin negotiating with the droids immediately. I appreciate your guidance.",	"m9o":"My friend's cloud car has crashed! I've just received news that the pilot survived, but is stranded a long way from here. I'm counting on you to escort my friend back here before it's too late.",	"m9p":"I was scouting this terrain for mineral deposits, when something fired on my vehicle. I think I got too close to a smuggling base, or pirates. I'm really, really glad to see you.",	"m9t":"Lucky Pilot",	"m9c":"Oh, no! This poor citizen looks awful. I'll contact the appropriate authorities. It's an honor to have had your help. Please accept this reward.",	"m9e":"Don't I know your name? You're famous for something -- the Alliance? The Empire? I can't think too well right now. I'm just grateful you saved my life.",	"m10o":"I've heard of you! Everyone around here knows you. I've got a friend waaay out in the countryside who'd love to meet you and get your autograph. I'll pay you for the journey, don't worry.",	"m10p":"Why, this is a treat! That's so nice of my friend to think of me all the way out here. Tell you what, take me back with you. That'll give me something to talk about down at the cantina.",	"m10t":"You Must Have Me Confused",	"m10c":"You brought my friend here! Now that's service. I didn't expect such thoughtfulness. Please accept this token of my great gratitude.",	"m10e":"I'll be sure to tell my friend all about your exploits. I'll remember this trip for a long time, believe me.",	"m11o":"That blasted idiot! I gave warning after warning -- \"Don't go out there,\" I said. And now look! Can you go out and fetch this nincompoop?",	"m11p":"I was looking for something cute. Now I think I hear growling and hissing out there, and I'm a little scared.",	"m11t":"An Unlucky Explorer",	"m11c":"Help me convince this numbskull: Baby predators, bad-bad! Because they have parents! Is that so hard to understand, even for a droid-headed dimwit?",	"m11e":"I'm glad you brought me back. I just wanted to pet some nice little baby animals.",	"m12o":"I've had a call that a diplomat, who is trying to stop a war between two nearby worlds, has crash-landed far from here. Can you escort the official here, while I arrange safe transport off-world?",	"m12p":"Ah. Yes. All will go well now that you've arrived, I'm sure. Please escort me to our destination, using all due caution, and I'm sure you will be suitably rewarded.",	"m12t":"Bewildered Diplomat",	"m12c":"I've arranged another ship for our official friend here. Thank you so much for helping during this emergency.",	"m12e":"You have my profoundest thanks for your diligent and courageous service. The cause of intergalactic peace will not perish this day.",	"m13o":"I have a friend with a cybernetic nerve implant, but it's malfunctioning. My friend has been behaving a little, well, strangely, wandering off into the wilderness. I have a new replacement for the implant, but I need you to rescue my friend. Please hurry!",	"m13p":"You're an Imperial walker! No, wait, that's wrong. Sith lord! No. Hold on. Must steady myself. I think you've arrived just in time. Please get me back to my friend.",	"m13t":"Very Confused Individual",	"m13c":"That implant was supposed to cure a nervous condition. Instead, when it fritzes out, it makes things worse. Thank you for this brave rescue!",	"m13e":"Scout walkers everywhere! No, it's a superlaser! Aaah! No, no -- I must stabilize -- all right. I think I'll be better now that my friend is here.",	"m14o":"My droid popped its restraining bolt and headed out into the wilderness. My friend went to catch it while I hunted down a new bolt. They've both been gone a long time. I'll pay you to go and bring them back safely.",	"m14p":"Nothing is left of the droid but this burned-out motivator. Looks like predators started playing with it. I have no idea how the thing made it this far from home.",	"m14t":"Tenacious Droid",	"m14c":"My droid, destroyed? Argh, what a nuisance. Well, thanks for rescuing my friend, at least. By rights I should only owe you half -- well, never mind, here's your full reward. Unless you'd like this nice restraining bolt instead?",	"m14e":"Thanks for bringing me back. I expect my friend had insurance on that droid. So don't worry, your reward won't do any lasting financial damage.",	"m15o":"Some kind of military activity has stranded my employees out in the wilderness. I don't know the details. The distress call was garbled. Please, can you perform a rescue?",	"m15p":"We were driving along, when wham! A giant explosion blew up our landspeeder and killed everyone else. I was thrown clear. I think it was the Empire. My friends (sob)--",	"m15t":"A Tragic Accident",	"m15c":"Hmm. Are my competitors stooping to brutal tactics, using the galactic civil war as cover? That seems the safest assumption, if you know what I mean. Please don't tell anyone what happened here.",	"m15e":"Imperial artillery practice, that's what it was, I'm sure! I won't let my boss cover up this atrocity, you hear? Citizens must know!",	"m16o":"Our local Youth Explorer troop was due back from a field trip, but I just got an automated distress call. Please, go out there, find what happened, and bring everyone back!",	"m16p":"I'm the field trip organizer. The kids ate some kind of local bush and, I don't know, went native. They all ran off. Please get me back to town so I can call in a search party.",	"m16t":"Going Native",	"m16c":"The kids must have eaten wanderweed blooms. Now they're probably all convinced they're Shistavanen wolfmen or something. I'll organize a patrol.",	"m16e":"Thanks for getting me back here alive. Yes, I lead these field trips, but I personally never managed to earn the Survival merit badge.",	"m17o":"Both my business partners are prospecting the countryside for minerals. One just sent an automated distress call. I want to hire you to find out what's going on out there.",	"m17p":"Murrgen -- the third partner in our business -- knocked me out and absconded with our records! I don't know why, but I want that treacherous thief arrested!",	"m17t":"Find the Prospectors",	"m17c":"No! Murrgen must have found some rich site, and greed drove him to try killing my partner. And that means he'll be after me next....",	"m17e":"Not much can drive one crazy faster than greed. After all those years together! Well, Murrgen's days are numbered now. I'm hiring a bounty hunter!",	"m18o":"Listen, this should be simple. There's a certain spacer who owes me money and is many credits behind on the payments. Bring me my money or bring me the spacer. Either way, I'll pay you well.",	"m18p":"Heavens, I don't have the money to pay you! Please don't hurt me. Take me to the one who hired you, and I'll see if we can settle this account face-to-face.",	"m18t":"Collect a Debt",	"m18c":"So, the spacer didn't have the credits to pay me, eh? I'm sure I can extract some other kind of payment instead. Thanks for the help, buddy.",	"m18e":"Oh, dear. Since I don't have the money, I hope my family and I will be safe. At least you were kind to me. Thank you!",	"m19o":"I had my purchasing agent take a refurbished military-surplus landspeeder for a test drive. I've heard no word for quite some time, and I'm worried. Can you investigate? For a fee, of course.",	"m19p":"Oh, boy, am I glad you found me. The wreck is way back there somewhere. It started babbling about \"hostile terrain\" and \"taking evasive action,\" and then I lost control and crashed! Please take me back so I can report.",	"m19t":"A Refurbished Jalopy",	"m19c":"I think the salesman did mention that the vehicle had a reconditioned 5th-Class droid brain. Scary thought, really. I thank you for your good work.",	"m19e":"These are sad times when you have to worry about your own landspeeder getting contrary. Thanks for saving my life.",	"m20o":"I heard there's a bounty out for Imperial TIE pilot DS-61-4, nicknamed Dark Curse. He's supposed to be hiding out on this world. I sent a scout looking for him, but haven't heard back. Did Dark Curse get my scout? I'd like you to check it out.",	"m20p":"I've tromped all over this stupid world without finding Dark Curse. Did burn out my comlink, though. I'm glad to see you; let's go back together, shall we?",	"m20t":"Find the Imperial Pilot",	"m20c":"It turns out I may have misread the name on the wanted notice. It appears Dark Curse isn't wanted, after all, that I know of. Oh well, here's your fee anyway.",	"m20e":"That Dark Curse is supposed to be a tough customer -- survived the battle of Yavin, they say! -- but I never did find a reason why anyone would put a bounty on him.",	"m21o":"Any news about that crashed drone barge? Wait, aren't you --? Oh, sorry. Listen, I need you to check the status of an employee out in the wilderness. I'll pay well.",	"m21p":"My boss heard reports that a drone barge loaded with ditanium crashed on this world. I was supposed to look for it. A swoop gang attacked me, I lost my comlink, and the day went downhill from there. Please, take me home!",	"m21t":"Drone Barge Accident",	"m21c":"Well, is there a crashed drone barge or isn't there? I'll have to send this slacker out again to check!",	"m21e":"Oh, I'm so glad to be back home. I hope I don't have to leave again for a long, long time. Thanks so much for saving my life!",	"m22o":"The Empire has offered a fat reward for information about a rumored Rebel command headquarters on this world. I sent out many scouts to locate it, but found nothing. One scout has yet to report back. I'm hiring you to find out whether those filthy rebels captured my agent.",	"m22p":"No command HQ to be found out here. What? Any Alliance activity? Oh, no, no-- Why don't you lead me back to my employer?",	"m22t":"Confirm Imperial Rumors",	"m22c":"This scout looks suspicious somehow. Subversion, do you think? Perhaps I should call Imperial Security, just to be sure. Thanks, you can go.",	"m22e":"Do we really know that those Alliance people are awful traitors? Wouldn't it make sense to look at their position before turning them in to the Empire for a quick reward? I'm just asking, that's all.",	"m23o":"I hired an agent to search for a sentimental keepsake I lost near here. I keep hearing field reports from further and further away, and my requests to call off the search don't seem to get through. Can you please go tell this citizen to stop searching?",	"m23p":"It seems a local herbivore swallowed the keepsake, a pair of electrobinoculars. Then the animal started traveling across the landscape on a migratory route. I was happy to follow, because I'm paid by the hour. But if my employer wants me back, let's go.",	"m23t":"Find a Sentimental Keepsake",	"m23c":"Egad, what a bill! I didn't expect this when I wanted to recover my father's old electrobinocs. And now there's your fee as well. Here, take it and go!",	"m23e":"Thanks for accompanying me back here. I appreciated having someone else around to do the guard work. I'll present my bill to my employer now.",	"m24o":"Is it true that HoloNet star Ando Blast is on this world? My fan club news service is reporting he's at these coordinates. Can you go and invite him here, pleeease?",	"m24p":"I'm obviously not Ando Blast, but a producer scouting locations for the next Blast mega-epic. Ando himself is in fact computer-generated. But I'd like to meet the fan who sent you out here. Lead the way.",	"m24t":"Find Ando Blast",	"m24c":"Wow, Ando Blast's producer! Not as good as Ando, but -- here, you've earned your fee. Wow, maybe my home will show up in Ando's next epic!",	"m24e":"Well, that was a longer trip than I figured. But I did get a lot of good location info. I also like to beat the bushes locally to drum up ratings. Thanks, you're great.",	"m25o":"I have a very important meeting scheduled, but my business contact inadvertently landed on the other side of the planet. If you can provide a safe escort back to me, I will compensate you from my operating funds.",	"m25p":"Most curious that my contact did not meet me in person. Very well, take me to this meeting place and we'll determine what game is afoot.",	"m25t":"Find the Business Contact",	"m25c":"I'm sorry I used you, but I had to catch my old enemy off guard. Here's the payment I promised you. Now run along. My old enemy and I have much to discuss.",	"m25e":"I might have known that my \"business contact\" was actually my old arch-nemesis! Which explains the trouble we had getting here. I'm sorry you're caught in the middle of this, friend.",	"number_of_entries":"25"
