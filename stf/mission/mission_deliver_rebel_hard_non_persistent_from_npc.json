We will not stand by and watch our patriots executed.",	"m2d":"One of our strike teams is hitting an Imperial depot in the Outer Rim. We want Imperial Intelligence to suspect we're hitting another target. We need a trusted agent to pick up falsified Alliance communiques and deliver them to our HoloNet slicer.

Don't you? Haha!",	"m2p":"Here are the communiques. Remember, you can rarely use the same trick twice against the Empire.",	"m2t":"Help Fool the Empire",	"m2s":"Good work, comrade. It's the efforts of agents like you that will insure the Empire's defeat. ",	"m3d":"Although a terrible tragedy, the destruction of Alderaan has boosted our ranks. We need someone to pick up a datadisc and deliver it to our processing officer. It contains thousands of enlistees, many of them skilled pilots. This new influx of talent may be what the Alliance needs to turn the tide of battle against the Empire. Will you help? ",	"m3l":"Datadisc",	"m3o":"",	"m3f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m3r":"Thanks for the delivery. How typical of the Empire to not understand that fear can become hate very easily.",	"m3p":"The Princess said it best: \"The more the Empire tightens its grip, the more star systems will slip through its fingers.\"",	"m3t":"Help Boost the Alliance's Ranks",	"m3s":"Those extra recruits are much needed. Thanks for your efforts. The Alliance will reward you.",	"m4d":"We must constantly keep our cells supplied and their agents equipped. We need couriers to pick up supply requests and deliver them to our requisitions officer. These couriers will make sure our brave freedom fighters have what they need to fight the Empire.

Can we count on you?",	"m5l":"Datadisc",	"m5o":"",	"m5f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m5r":"I hear these are modeled on the TIE flight sims. Our pilots will benefit greatly.

The Alliance is grateful.",	"m6d":"Some of our agents have attempted to enlist with the Empire in order to spy for the Alliance. We believe Imperial Intelligence has identified a large number of these agents. We need someone to pick up encrypted orders from High Command and deliver them to our local cell contact.

Well done!",	"m7d":"Ever since the destruction of the Death Star, the number of Alliance enlistees has risen dramatically. We suspect that some of them may be double agents working for the Empire. Can you pick up an encrypted roster of suspicious enlistees and deliver them to our High Command contact? We must help the Alliance remain free of Imperial spies.",	"m7l":"Datadisc",	"m7o":"",	"m7f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m7r":"Sometimes these double agents are hard to spot. We'll do our best.

We're lucky to have you on our side.",	"m8d":"Our slicers intercepted a secret Imperial communique revealing that the Empire has dossiers of all the surviving Battle of Yavin pilots.

The security of the Heroes of Yavin is one of our top priorities.",	"m9d":"We've discovered a flaw in the design of older stormtrooper helmet comlinks. We need a trusted agent to pick up our technical analysis and deliver it to a local cell contact. We can use this flaw to intercept squad communications. This information will mostly benefit our cells on remote outposts. Think you can handle this mission? ",	"m9l":"Datadisc",	"m9o":"",	"m9f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m9r":"This should come in handy. I always wondered what stormtroopers chatted about when they were just standing around.",	"m9p":"Here's the analysis. We should act quickly since we don't know how long this flaw will go unnoticed by the Empire.",	"m9t":"Listen in on Stormtroopers",	"m9s":"Job well done, citizen. The Alliance is glad to have trusted agents like you. ",	"m10d":"Our slicers' efforts to send bogus orders to Imperial garrisons has been very effective -- in fact, too effective. The Imperials have now taken to hand-delivering orders, which leaves our slicers vulnerable to Imperial Intelligence. We need someone to pick up new encryption codes and deliver them to our local slicers. Can we rely on you?",	"m10l":"Datadisc",	"m10o":"",	"m10f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m10r":"Really? I gotta stop? Aww, just when I was having such fun. Okay, I'll tell our gang to cool their jets. We'll institute these new codes right away.",	"m10p":"Here are the new codes. They should help protect our data slicers. It's good to see our tactics are working, however.",	"m10t":"Save the Data Slicers",	"m10s":"That should keep Imperial Intelligence guessing for a bit longer. Those goons are certainly dedicated, I'll give them that. Thanks for your help.",	"m11d":"The Empire plans on arresting many former Senators and their families. We need someone to pick up the list of possible targets and deliver them to one of our HoloNet slicers so they can warn these individuals.

Can you help us?",	"m11l":"Datadisc",	"m11o":"",	"m11f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m11r":"This warning will no doubt be intercepted by the Imperial Analysis Bureau.

",	"m12d":"The New Order's stance on alien species has given us an edge in recruiting these neglected citizens. Of special interest to High Command are the Duros. We need a courier to pick up encrypted orders and deliver them to one of our agents specializing in Alien Species Affairs. They are to travel to Duro and continue negotiating with the Duros' leaders.",	"m12l":"Datadisc",	"m12o":"",	"m12f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m12r":"I think the Duros are determined to remain neutral but I'll continue negotiating with them.",	"m12p":"Here are the orders. Many other alien species would follow the Duros' example if they were to join the Alliance.",	"m12t":"Help Rally the Aliens",	"m12s":"The Alliance appreciates your efforts. With luck, disenfranchised species will boost our ranks and help us topple the Empire.",	"m13d":"One of our refueling stations in the Outer Rim has been compromised, and we believe that the Empire is using it as bait to capture Alliance transports. An encrypted set of orders must be picked up and delivered to our local cell leader. We must insure that every transport captain and pilot aiding the Alliance receives these orders.",	"m13l":"Datadisc",	"m13o":"",	"m13f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m13r":"We'll get this information out to our pilots at once.

Our pilots are a very precious resource and we must do all we can to protect them. ",	"m14d":"We have proof that an Imperial prison official at Kessel has been supplying glitterstim to smugglers and Black Sun. We need someone to pick up an encrypted message and deliver it to one of our couriers. We intend to present our \"terms\" to the Imperial official. He either cooperates with us, or we turn over our proof to Imperial Intelligence.",	"m14l":"Datadisc",	"m14o":"",	"m14f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m14r":"Good old-fashioned blackmail, eh? Hey, if it's effective --",	"m14p":"Remember, we do what we must to insure the fall of the Empire. In this case, it should be fun.",	"m14t":"Blackmail the Empire",	"m14s":"Well done. Remember to keep this quiet. We don't want word of this getting around to Imperial Intelligence.",	"m15d":"We've received a request from Commander Skywalker. He'd like us to get our hands on an Imperial Inquisitor. We need someone to pick up his encrypted orders and deliver them to our local cell commander.

Good luck.",	"m15t":"Nab an Imperial Inquisitor",	"m15s":"That was well done. With any luck, we'll be able to supply Commander Skywalker with an Inquisitor very soon. I wonder what he has in mind?",	"m16d":"A shipment of Merr-Sonn IR-5 \"Intimidator\" blaster pistols has fallen into our hands. We need someone to pick up inventory discs and deliver them to our local cell commanders. They can request these weapons for upcoming missions, especially any dealing with smugglers and pirates -- those types are easily intimidated. Can we rely on you?",	"m16l":"Datadisc",	"m16o":"",	"m16f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m16r":"I've seen those blasters. Effective weapons indeed. I'll look through this inventory carefully.",	"m16p":"Here you go. And remind the commanders that these weapons not only look intimidating, they also pack quite a punch.",	"m16t":"Disperse the Nasty Guns",	"m16s":"Excellent, citizen. These weapons will help our undercover agents deal with those unpredictable smugglers.",	"m17d":"A generous planetary governor has donated several new MD series medical droids. Could you pick up the specs for these droids and deliver them to our local cell commander? All requests for these droid must go through Winter, who will process them directly. Make sure the commanders make a strong case or they may not get one.",	"m17l":"Datadisc",	"m17o":"",	"m17f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m17r":"My people sure could use one of those droids.

These sorts of donations help keep the Alliance strong.",	"m17t":"Medical Droids for Everybody",	"m17s":"Thanks for your help. The Alliance could use more reliable couriers like yourself. ",	"m18d":"We found some old Trade Federation droidekas. These might be useful on certain missions or as security droids on some of our bases.

I always heard that's why the Trade Federation stopped using them. Well, I'll pass this along.",	"m18p":"Here you go. Inform High Command that the droidekas seem to be in perfect condition. I don't believe they were ever activated.",	"m18t":"A Blast From the Past",	"m18s":"We appreciate your help, citizen. The Alliance has compensated you for your efforts.

Your silence will save many lives. ",	"m21d":"We've learned that a Moff is spearheading an attempt to assassinate the Emperor.

I hope the Princess takes this warning to heart. Sometimes she's too brave for her own good.",	"m24d":"Our agents have discovered that four Imperial Star Destroyers will be in space dock at the same time.
