Please hurry!",	"m1l":"Datadisc",	"m1o":"Alliance Intelligence",	"m1r":"So now I've got to get arrested, huh? All right, this officer has served the Alliance faithfully. I won't let him down.

Next, we have to free that field agent who slugged some stormtrooper. We may contact you again soon.",	"m1p":"As a top officer in the ISB, our covert infiltrator will review the record of the arrest personally.

We must be extremely cautious.",	"m3t":"A Secret Destination",	"m4d":"We believe that the Empire is preparing to strike Mon Calamari.

Help save them!",	"m4t":"Intercepted Transmissions",	"m5d":"The Empire has identified several Viceprexes in the Corporate Sector Authority who have been aiding the Alliance.

Thanks for the warning.",	"m5f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m5s":"A complete success, thanks to you!",	"m5p":"The Alliance is in constant need of supplies and military hardware. The CSA can provide us with that.",	"m5t":"Keep Our Allies Safe",	"m6d":"We've intercepted a transmission from Imperial Intelligence putting their Imperial Inquisitors on alert for Jedi.

",	"m6f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m6s":"We can't afford to lose such a great hero as Commander Skywalker. He inspires our troops and is a symbolic reminder of the Jedi of the Old Republic.

These agents will try to release a deadly airborne virus during the protests. Our scientists have obtained a sample of the virus and have developed an effective retrovirus. This sample of this retrovirus must be delivered to our agent, who can distribute it to all our field medics for duplication. You must be quick.

",	"m8l":"Datadisc",	"m8o":"Alliance Intelligence",	"m8r":"The Princess will want to go anyway, but I will warn her. She's a stubborn individual, you know.",	"m8f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m8s":"At least the Princess will be prepared for possible Imperial interference. ",	"m8p":"It seems that the Empire is always one step ahead of us. This must change.",	"m8t":"Warn a Princess",	"m9d":"Even though we managed to destroy the Empire's Dark Trooper facility, we have reason to believe that some of these mechanized stormtroopers survived. We even suspect that an improved model has been constructed. This message must be delivered to our one of our top HoloNet slicers, so we can put all our troops on alert. Will you help save the lives of Alliance fighters? ",	"m9l":"Datadisc",	"m9o":"Alliance High Command",	"m9r":"A new Dark Trooper? The old ones were bad enough.",	"m9f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m9s":"Mechanized efficiency is no match for a dedicated freedom fighter.

Apparently, he'd been instructed to infiltrate Jabba's Palace on Tatooine and realized that his life was considered expendable by the Empire.

The Alliance is counting on you.",	"m10l":"Datadisc",	"m10o":"Alliance Intelligence",	"m10r":"He would be helpful to our cause.

It would benefit us if the Guild learns of this. These communiques must be delivered to our contact within the Guild.

Are you up to the challenge?",	"m12l":"Datadisc",	"m12o":"Alliance Intelligence",	"m12r":"I suspect Black Sun was behind the attacks. We'll see what these transmissions reveal.",	"m12f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m12s":"We hope the bounty hunters will inerpret those transmissions the same way we did.

Let's take advantage of that.",	"m12t":"Bounty Hunter Allies",	"m13d":"Our top Incom engineer has just completed a design for a new starfighter code named the \"A-wing.\" We need this design delivered to one of our contacts, who will hand-deliver it to our secret manufacturing plant.

Working for the Alliance certainly builds character.",	"m15t":"Speeder Modifications",	"m16d":"We've received a very interesting proposition from someone claiming to be the leader of the Black Sun syndicate. This mysterious figure has offered the aid of their organization in exchange for any information we have about Darth Vader and the movements of his fleet. Can you deliver the details of this proposition to our intelligence officer, who will look into this offer more thoroughly?",	"m16l":"Datadisc",	"m16o":"Alliance High Command",	"m16r":"We'll check with the Black Sun Vigos we've worked with and verify this claim.",	"m16f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m16s":"You have proved a most trustworthy courier. Let's hope the mysterious Black Sun leader proves half as trustworthy.",	"m16p":"It would greatly benefit the Alliance if Darth Vader were removed from the picture -- though I'm not sure even Black Sun could take him.",	"m16t":"Black Sun Offer",	"m17d":"We've just received Winter's latest intelligence in preparation for our next procurement raid.

I hope we find some.",	"m18p":"Commander Skywalker has told us all he knew concerning Obi-Wan Kenobi. But I doubt we'll find other Jedi. Kenobi was probably unique.",	"m18t":"Jedi Wanted",	"m19d":"As difficult as it is, we need to quarantine the Graveyard of Alderaan. Imperial agents lie in wait for ships performing a Returning ritual, board the ships, and arrest the passengers and crew.

Can you do this?",	"m19l":"Datadisc",	"m19o":"Alliance High Command",	"m19r":"I'll see to it that these orders are obeyed.

Admiral Ozzel has taken the bait and believes Vader wishes to replace him with a junior officer. Rumor has it that the two rarely see eye-to-eye.

Are you the one for this mission?",	"m20l":"Datadisc",	"m20o":"Alliance Intelligence",	"m20r":"This mission has been a pleasure. We'll gladly keep it up.",	"m20f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m20s":"The more Admiral Ozzel clashes with Vader, the better off we'll be. Vader probably will replace him -- not that we care.",	"m20p":"Fortunately for us, the Empire's full of ambitious politicians eager to stab each other in the back.",	"m20t":"Sow Discord",	"m21d":"A fragment of an Imperial communique mentioned the \"Ison Corridor.\" We need these encrypted instructions delivered to Covert Operations. They are to investigate why the Empire is interested in this remote region of space. All findings should be hand-delivered by courier to General Rieekan's command staff.

We hope you accept.

These bounty hunters are getting more daring in their attempts to capture him. Apparently Solo offended a powerful Hutt on Tatooine.

Can you handle it?",	"m25l":"Datadisc",	"m25o":"Alliance High Command",	"m25r":"I'll deliver the message, but I doubt Jabba will negotiate. He wants Solo pretty bad.",	"m25f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m25s":"You've done your part. Now let's hope that Hutt is willing to listen to reason.
