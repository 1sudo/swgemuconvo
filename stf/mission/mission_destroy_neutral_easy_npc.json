		"m1d":"Some local thugs have been harassing the decent people of this neighborhood. They loiter around this abandoned shop and get high on glitterstim. We're offering a reward to any citizen with the guts to go in there and blast this shop to pieces. That would certainly get the point across, eh? Most of these thugs are bullies and cowards anyway, so we doubt they'd give you much trouble. Do you accept?",	"m1o":"A Group of Concerned Citizens",	"m1s":"Told you those creeps wouldn't put up much of a fight. Bet they don't come around here no more. The reward is yours.",	"m1t":"Run off the thugs",	"m2d":"Some local glitterstim pusher and a group of thugs has set up shop in our neighborhood and we want them out. We know where they hang out and need someone to go in there and redecorate the place (preferably with blasters). There's a decent reward in it for the brave individual that succeeds in driving those slugs away. Will you be our neighborhood's saviour? ",	"m2o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m2s":"That's showing those poison-pushers who's boss. Good work, citizen. The Empire could use more upstanding folk like you.",	"m2t":"Stop the drug dealers",	"m3d":"There's been an increase in break-ins around here recently. We know who's behind it but we can't collect enough evidence to get the local authorities to make arrests. It's time we took the law into our own hands. We're offering a reward to anyone who can run the criminals behind those thefts out of town. Blasting their hideout to atoms ought to get the point across. If you decide to help us out, we'll send you the coorindates to this wretched hive of scum and villainy.",	"m3o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m3s":"We sleep easier at night now. Good job, citizen. Hope you decide to work for us again.",	"m3t":"Stop the thieves",	"m4d":"A bunch of slimy slugs have moved into the neighborhood and have been harassing our wives and daughters. We've heard of these guys. They were run out of another town after they assaulted a young woman. We feel these predators will repeat that pattern soon, especially since many of our fairer family members work late at the factories. We need some of integrity and of true grit to make sure these criminals don't endanger anyone. We know where these creeps have set up shop and are certain they would vacate the premises if their lair were blasted to pieces. Can you help us? There's a reward in the offering.",	"m4o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m4s":"Well struck, citizen! Our womenfolk thank you as do we. Enjoy the reward.",	"m4t":"Get rid of slimy predators",	"m5d":"A shyster has been cheating some older retired folks out of their life savings. This creep goes around selling bogus cruises on luxury starliners that don't exist. Further, this slimeball has hired some local toughs, thinking that their presence will scare away any citizens seeking to get their money back. It's time we put a stop to this activity. We're offering a reward to the brave and honest individual who blasts this scum's headquarters to pieces and makes sure they don't plague another town ever again. If you decide that individual is you, let us know and we'll send you the coordinates to the creep's lair.",	"m5o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m5s":"Good work! No one has the right to cheat decent folk out of their life savings. You've made sure that point was made, citizen.",	"m5t":"Smash the shyster",	"m6d":"The same brutish thug has mugged half a dozen decent people in the last month, one of which died last night as a result of the injuries. That person was my father. I'd prefer to handle this animal on my own terms rather than get the local authorities involved. I'll pay a substantial reward to any citizen brave enough to help me get justice for my dead father. Slime like this want us to believe that life in the universe is cheap. Well I've got news for that slug - life is not cheap and the price of a life is a life. I hope you can help my father's soul find peace. The coordinates to this predator's lair await your acceptance of this mission.",	"m6o":"An Enraged Daughter",	"m6s":"Finally, my father's soul can rest. Thank you, citizen. Take the reward, you've earned it.",	"m6t":"Stop the murderous mugger",	"m7d":"Have you ever heard of the Vibrodagger Killer? We think we've finally tracked this heinous murderer down. They're hiding in a small abandoned settlement near here. We believe there may be other murderers hiding there with the killer. The time for justice is at hand. We need someone to go in there and wipe that place out. Burn it and everyone in it to the ground. Those filthy murderers deserve nothing better. A reward awaits the successful agent of justice. Are you that agent?",	"m7o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m7s":"That should put an end to these horrible crimes. Assuming it was the actual Vibrodagger Killer in that settlement, that is. You've earned your reward in any case.",	"m7t":"Stop the Vibrodagger Killer",	"m8d":"A gang of hooligans has been terrorizing our neighborhood for months now. Their favorite tactic is to hurl homemade firebombs at passing speeders. So far three people have been killed by these attacks. The local authorities are already swamped with work and can't devote the time necessary to stop these criminals. We need an independent agent to take up the cause of justice for us. We're offering a decent reward to anyone that blasts this gang's hangout to pieces. If the gang members get caught in the blast, so much the better. You willing to help clean up our community, citizen?",	"m8o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m8s":"Looks like you gave those thugs a taste of their own medicine. Good job! Our neighborhoods could use more folks like you.",	"m8t":"Drive out the destructive gang",	"m9d":"There's a gang of space trash that has decided to set up a protection racket in our area. Many of the local merchants have been forced to pay protection money after one shop was blown to pieces with the shop owner and his family still inside. The gang is paying bribes to the local law enforcement authorities so they ignore these criminal activities. We need someone to pay like with like and blow the gang's hideout to atoms. This agent of justice will be rewarded for their time and efforts, of course. The coordinates await your acceptance.",	"m9o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m9s":"We guess the gang forgot to pay their own protection money. Hehehe! Good work, citizen. The money is yours.",	"m9t":"Stop protection racket thugs",	"m10d":"A local glitterstim dealer got my son addicted to that poison and now my boy is rotting in an Imperial prison while the dealer continues to pedal their filth. It's time someone put a stop to this criminal's activities. I'm offering a reward to any citizen that goes into that dealer's lair and blasts everything in sight. If the dealer and their thug friends are there, blast them too. If you accept, I'll transmit the coordinates to the dealer's hangout. That nest of silica parasites needs to be cleaned out.",	"m10o":"An Angry Father",	"m10s":"You're an effective agent of justice, citizen. You've made the streets safer for our youth. This is one reward I am happy to pay.",	"m10t":"Stop glitterstim dealer",	"m11d":"My cousin was taken from me by a vicious gang of cutthroats operating in the area. I want someone to attack their hangout and blast every single one of those murderers to bits. Leave nothing standing. This gang's attacks have claimed many lives and shattered many families. Please help me find justice. I will reward you for your time. And our community will thank you for your service. Will you help me?",	"m11o":"A Determined Relative",	"m11s":"Well done, citizen. Now that you've killed the gangster that my cousin became, their soul can finally find rest and peace. Ever since my cousin started leading that vicious gang, I knew they were no longer the loving individual I grew up with - that person was truly dead. You've earned this reward.",	"m11t":"Stop violent gang",	"m12d":"A band of crooks kidnapped my young son several weeks ago and demanded a ransom. Before it could be paid, my dear son, who suffered from a rare form of asthma, died while being held by the kidnappers. The band fled the area but I've managed to track them down. I know they'll do this again to some other unlucky parent. Fortunately, I have the means to provide a substantial reward to anyone who can end the careers of these kidnappers and gain justice for my dead son. Will you accept?",	"m12o":"A Vengeful Mother",	"m12s":"You have my eternal gratitude. Now finally my son and I can find peace. Claim your reward.",	"m12t":"Stamp out the kidnappers",	"m13d":"Pirates are a plague on interstellar shipping. Those murderous thieves end up costing the Empire millions of credits each year, not to mention the resources necessary to hunt them down or the terrible loss of life their attacks incur. One way we can hit those pirates hard is by cutting their access to safe ports and hideouts. It's not easy to hide a spaceship, even the smaller fighters employed by some of these rogues. We know of several suspicious outposts big enough to contain landing bays. We need the help of upstanding citizens to blast these outposts to pieces. We compensate for results not attempts. Do you think you can help keep the star lanes safe?",	"m13o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m13s":"Good work, citizen. Keep at it and we'll keep paying you.",	"m13t":"Take out the pirates' landing bays",	"m14d":"If pirates don't have working ships, they can't practice their despicable trade. We've learned of several small storage facilities in the area that house a wide assortment of spare ship parts. We're fairly certain that these are pirate stashes, especially given the shady characters that are often seen guarding these places. Our own personnel are already stretched rather thin but the Empire has granted us additional credits to hire independent agents to help us take care of the pirate problem. We need someone to blast these facilities to atoms. You may encounter some armed resistance, but hey, these are dangerous criminals we're dealing with after all. Can you help?",	"m14o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m14s":"Pirate ships floating uselessly in space is an image we like, citizen. Good work in helping us to ground those marauding vessels.",	"m14t":"Blow up the pirates' spare parts",	"m15d":"Ever wonder where pirates store their ill-gotten goods, citizen? We've discovered a few places and we need them destroyed. Our agents are too busy investigating murders and violent crimes to attend to this matter themselves so we've decided to turn to you - the average upstanding citizen. We'll compensate you for every storage facility on our list that you blast to atoms. No questions asked, just go in blasting and take out anyone trying to stand in your way. We'll transmit the coordinates to you as soon as you accept.  ",	"m15o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m15s":"Job well done, citizen. The money is yours.",	"m15t":"Blast pirate's stash",	"m16d":"A group of known pirates have started hanging around an abandoned settlement. That place is beginning to attract all manner of scum. We're fairly certain they deal glitterstim spice out of there and no telling what else. Can you imagine what sorts of other criminal activities are going on there even as you read this? We've had enough. We want to hire someone to blast that den of thieves into oblivion. Do you think you can help us keep our communities free of these parasites? We'll send along the coordinates to the settlement as soon as we have your confirmation.",	"m16o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m16s":"That's showing them, citizen. Those space slugs will think twice about crossing our path. You've earned your reward.",	"m16t":"Demolish the pirates' hangout",	"m17d":"Those thieving pirates wouldn't be able to operate if it weren't for their fences. After all, it's not exactly as if those rogues could just traipse down to the local market with all their stolen goods, now is it? Those darn fences are just as culpable as the murderers they deal with as far as we're concerned. We've tracked down a few of these \"blood money traders\" and want their operations terminated. Many of these fences are former pirates themselves who either have grown too old to continue their murderous careers or else suffered enough physical damage to force an early retirement. If we provide you with the locations of these fences, will you make sure they pay the price for dealing with these killers? Help us save innocent lives. ",	"m17o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m17s":"If we make piracy unprofitable, perhaps it will end. You're certainly doing your part, citizen. Congratulations.",	"m17t":"Take out the fences",	"m18d":"Like all vermin, pirates need holes they can crawl down into when they're in danger of being exterminated. We've located some of these safehouses in our area and want these places blasted into oblivion. We're offering a decent reward to any citizen who can help us get rid of these vermin-infested places. If you think you've got what it takes, accept this mission and we'll send you the coordinates to some of these wretched hovels. Help keep our streets clean!",	"m18o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m18s":"As an Exterminator for Justice, citizen, you shine like a supernova. Keep up the excellent work and remember that your children will inherit this galaxy.",	"m18t":"Blast pirate's hideout",	"m19d":"I lost my beautiful wife in a dastardly pirate raid a year ago. Since that time, I've spent every waking moment and my entire fortune tracking down the pirate captain that led that cowardly attack. Now, I've finally managed to track that blackguard down. The time for my dead wife's vengeance is at hand. How I wish I could be the actual instrument of that devil's demise but alas the attack that robbed me of my wife left me a physical wreck. That's why I need someone like you. Help me avenge my dear wife. Her voice cries out from beyond oblivion for justice. If successful, you will walk away with both my gratitude and a handsome reward. ",	"m19o":"A Justice Seeker",	"m19s":"My thanks, friend. I can now join my beloved wife wherever she may be. You've helped two wayward souls find each other again. Farewell.",	"m19t":"Avenge a murder",	"m20d":"Oh, a pirate's life is a terrible thing. That's right, I used to run in those villainous circles myself until the treacherous nature of the scum around me brought me to ruin and almost robbed me of my life. Now, as the tragic and tortured soul that I've become, I seek only one thing - to make things right with the folks whose lives I so callously ruined. And I'd like to start by bringing my former \"partner\" to justice. Aye, that womp rat is richly deserving of a painful and gruesome death (for all those innocents that were slaughtered by that devil, of course) and I hope to play some part in making sure those wrongs are redressed. I'd attend to this matter personally, but you see I've taken holy vows never again to shed blood again. But seeing as there are others in the galaxy not burdened by this noble stricture, I've decided to offer a reward to anyone who can help me achieve my quest. I hope that someone is you, friend. Say aye and the coordinates to this putrid pile's hideout will be yours. Please, for the sake of the lost little ones, blast away at everything in sight. Bless you.",	"m20o":"A Reformed Soul",	"m20s":"Well struck, friend! Did you burn the place to the ground? Were there any of those murderous pirates inside the struture when it went up? Oh how I wish I could have heard the agonized screams of the unjust. Claim your reward.",	"m20t":"Help avenge a betrayal",	"m21d":"There's been a sudden increase of pirate activity in this sector. We investigated and discovered a secret refueling depot that those rogues had built to aid them in launching attacks from this system. We're in need of a professional problem solver to get rid of this refueling station so those criminals stop visiting our planet. There will be adequate compensation for the being who succeeds. Can you lend a helping hand, citizen?",	"m21o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m21s":"That should discourage those thieving vermin to steer clear of this system. Good work, citizen. Hope you decide to work for us again.",	"m21t":"Take out the pirates' refueling depot",	"m22d":"An old starship repair shop was purchased recently by a newcomer. Didn't think much of it until we started getting reports of suspicious activity around the shop at odd hours of the night. After an investigation, we discovered that the newcomer is actually a former smuggler whose new career consists of serving as a mechanic to well-known pirates. Tragically, the contact who helped us discover this information paid for it with his life - we found him a few days ago stuffed in a crate of alluvial dampers. These murderers must be stopped and justice must be served. Can you help us put this criminal out of business, citizen?  ",	"m22o":"Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations",	"m22s":"Good job, citizen. Justice is served today. We hope you decide to work for us again.",	"m22t":"Take out pirates' repair shop",	"m23d":"In the event of his death, my master instructed me to transmit this request via the HoloNet to all available terminals. I am to send a generous amount of credits to the being that can successfully destroy a small landing bay, the coordinates to which I am to transmit upon receiving someone's acceptance of this mission. My master was not terribly specific as to why he wished this facility blasted to pieces but I do know that he ran with a rather \"dubious\" crowd. The security at our home is most impressive, which leads me to conclude he had a reason to fear for his life. A shame this security could not travel with him - he might still be alive had this been the case. In any event, if you think you can accomplish this task, distasteful though it might appear, please respond as soon as possible. Thank you.",	"m23o":"An Obedient Droid",	"m23s":"Wonderful! I am now allowed to transmit the full amount of the reward to your account. My master would be so pleased... if he were still here. Oh dear...",	"m23t":"Help the faithful droid",	"m24d":"Pirates and smugglers are all the same - they should all be spaced! Just when I think it's safe to trust one of those slug-sucking rogues, they go and break my heart all over again. Well I can break things too, you know. I'll offer a reward to anyone that blasts that cheating 's landing bay (with their precious ship still inside) into oblivion. We'll show those brutes they can't just walk all over any woman they want. We have feelings and passions, and those can be roused for both good and ill. If you were ever treated this way by someone, I'm sure you'll lend a hand. I'll transmit the coordinates to the landing bay as soon as I receive a positive response. Consider this a strike for women all across the galaxy.",	"m24o":"A Woman Scorned",	"m24s":"Not only my gratitude but the gratitude of women throughout the galaxy goes with you. Thank you for helping us stand up to these heartbreaking rogues.",	"m24t":"Help avenge a scorned woman",	"m25d":"These darn smugglers think they can stash their ill-gotten goods anywhere they darn please. Well they're wrong. A concerned group of citizens is willing to put up a reward to be claimed by anyone willing to blast these stashes to smithereens. These smugglers are cowards in any case, doubt they'd put up much of a fight. You willing to give it a try, citizen? ",	"m25o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m25s":"The Empire could use more upstanding folk like yourself. Claim your reward, citizen, you've earned it.",	"m25t":"Blast illegal stash",	"m26d":"We've found an old abandoned settlement that's currently being used by some local smugglers to store their stolen goods. The local authorities don't seem to care (they're busy chasing \"dangerous Rebels\"), which leaves this dirty work for us citizens. We're offering a reward to anyone willing to help get rid of this smugglers' depot. Don't leave a single wall standing, citizen. You up for it?",	"m26o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m26s":"Now those are results we can appreciate, citizen. Good work! The reward is yours.",	"m26t":"Remove smuggler's depot",	"m27d":"We've seen shady characters loitering around certain locations, and don't think we don't know what's going on. Smugglers have been known to frequent these parts and we all know what they do. We've pinpointed one of these so called \"warehouses\" and need it blown to atoms, and we're willing to offer a reward to the citizen who'll take up the challenge. We won't stand for this sort of activity in our own backyards. Think you can help, citizen? ",	"m27o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m27s":"That's showing those hooligans, citizen. I bet those smugglers won't come around here no more. Don't spend that reward all in one place.",	"m27t":"Take out smuggler's warehouse",	"m28d":"I remember when this neighborhood used to be a decent place for citizens to raise their families. Well a bad element has been moving into our community. Smugglers! They sweep in here with their bluster and charm and think we don't see exactly what they're up to? I got news for them - we know exactly what they're up to! I'm willing to put up a reward to get a brave citizen to encourage these criminals to get out of town. There's a small hideout near here where these smugglers have been meeting. If someone could blast that place to atoms, that'd send a strong signal to those ne'er-do-wells. Think you can lend a hand, citizen?",	"m28o":"A Concerned Citizen",	"m28s":"That's giving them what for, citizen! Job well done! The reward money is yours, my friend.",	"m28t":"Encourage smugglers to leave",	"m29d":"Some smuggler has been hanging about chatting with the neighborhood kids. No doubt they're encouraging our young ones to turn to a life of crime. We need a brave and upstanding citizen to help us drive this criminal out of our area. Here are the coordinates to this scoundrel's hangout. Several sustained shots from a heavy blaster ought to get the point across. Burn this hangout to ashes and you'll drive this womp rat out of its den. A reward awaits the citizen who accomplishes this.",	"m29o":"Citizens for a Clean Tomorrow",	"m29s":"Now our children have a shot at a clean future. Good work, citizen! This reward is but a small token of our esteem.",	"m29t":"Get rid of the smuggler",	"m30d":"Why must smugglers always be attracted to areas where decent folk choose to live? I suppose they think they're less likely to be caught by the local authorities. Well I'm going to prove them wrong. I'm offering a reward to anyone brave enough to blast a local smuggler's haunt to atoms. I'm a family man with young ones dependent on me, otherwise I'd do the deed myself. Most of these types are cowards anyway and run at the first sign of trouble. Do you think you can help our community out, citizen?",	"m30o":"An Angry Citizen",	"m30s":"See? Bet that coward gave you no troubles. The reward is yours, good citizen. You've earned it.",	"m30t":"Scare the smuggler away",	"m31d":"These cheap smugglers think they can swagger into someone's life, charm that person with their devilish good looks and winning smile, use that innocent individual to further their own ends, and then dump that poor soul like a sack of bantha fodder when they're done. Well I have news for these heartbreakers - this is one poor soul that's striking back! I'm willing to pay a handsome reward to the noble individual who helps defend a woman's honor. I know where this cheating smuggler has stashed their latest catch. It's worth quite a bit to them, which is why I want it burned to the ground. Can you take up this cause, citizen? Will you be my very own Jedi knight?  ",	"m31o":"A Woman Scorned",	"m31s":"Success, my Jedi! That cheating scum will think twice about using another woman again. I'll gladly pay my Jedi's reward.

But all of this has yielded no results. They're still engaged in smuggling. Now, I must turn to more drastic measures. That's the only thing that will save my poor cousin's life. I know where they're keeping a small shipment of illegal weapons and if someone were to burn this hiding place to the ground, I'm sure my cousin would realize the grave danger they're in and abandon their life of crime. Can you help me with this, citizen? There's a reward in it for you. Please try and spare my cousin, however. They're the handsome one with the winning smile.

Well this \"captain\" ended up keeping these valuables rather than delivering them to the appointed location - a move which cost me a considerable amount of money. I believe this captain needs a lesson. So much so that I'm putting up my own money as a reward to make sure this lesson is well taught. I have the coordinates to this captain's hangout and am in need of an enterprising individual with a very large blaster to collect this reward.
