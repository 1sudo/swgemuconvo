		"m1d":"This office has uncovered several Rebel sympathizers and is planning a purge. Rebel slicers are infesting the HoloNet, so we need these warrants hand-delivered. After all, we don't want to give those scum the chance to escape justice. Tell no one!",	"m1l":"Datadisc",	"m1o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m1r":"Everything seems in order. Now we can move and purge those sympathizers.",	"m1f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m1s":"This office will remember your service to the Empire.

The rewards are many.",	"m1t":"Arrest Warrants",	"m2d":"One of our spies, who are everywhere, is conducting an important surveillance mission. We've ordered the agent to maintain transmission silence. You never know who's listening. These new orders must be delivered to the agent at once. Can the Empire count on you?",	"m2l":"Datadisc",	"m2o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m2r":"New orders, eh? Thank you, citizen. The Empire does not forget its loyal servants.",	"m2f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m2s":"Inform no one of the spy's identity, or it will go badly for you. That is all.",	"m2p":"Our work is never done. Preserving the New Order should be everyone's concern.",	"m2t":"Spy's New Orders",	"m3d":"We have a report that Rebels are meeting in a concealed chamber under an informant's home. Deliver a heat sensor so the homeowner can verify this suspicion.",	"m3l":"Scanner device",	"m3o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m3r":"Finally! I'll be able to prove that there's a Rebel Command Center underneath my very home! How do you work this thing? ",	"m3f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m3s":"We must investigate all such claims, no matter how seemingly outlandish. That is our job -- our duty -- our cause.",	"m3p":"The ISB is always looking for bright, eager talent. What better way to serve the Empire?",	"m3t":"Heat Scanner",	"m4d":"A citizen informs us that certain locals have been holding clandestine meetings, possibly to aid the Rebellion. Deliver this message to the loyal citizen. It includes a reward for diligence.",	"m4l":"Datadisc",	"m4o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m4r":"I knew my rude neighbors were up to no good. They'll get what they deserve now. Bless the Empire! ",	"m4f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m4s":"Though Rebel sympathizers hide everywhere, assure all who will listen that the Empire has matters well in hand.",	"m4p":"We only wish all citizens were as loyal as the recipient of this datadisc -- and as loyal as you are, too, citizen!",	"m4t":"Loyalty Reward",	"m5d":"An upstanding citizen believes an acquaintance is secretly attending meetings with Rebels. Deliver this tagger spy device to the informant. Once this citizen plants a transmitter on the suspected traitor, we can monitor his movements.",	"m5l":"Small gun or tracker device",	"m5o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m5r":"Great gadget. I could never afford this on my own. Now my father will regret stopping my allowance!",	"m5f":"filename_of_object",	"m5s":"Rebel sympathizers are everywhere. Our informants' motives may be petty, but their vital service triumphs over all other moral considerations.",	"m5p":"Traitors hide behind many facades. They may be close friends, even loved ones. In the end, all must face justice.",	"m5t":"Spy Tagger Device",	"m6d":"One loyal citizen has helped us arrest over a dozen Rebel sympathizers. We want to show our appreciation by presenting them with a plaque. It bears the COMPNOR pledge along with the citizen's name engraved on the front. Perhaps you can one day earn such a plaque, citizen. For now, please simply deliver the plaque.",	"m6l":"Plaque",	"m6o":"COMPNOR",	"m6r":"My plaque! I'll hang it in a place of honor. I can't wait to show my friends. The few remaining loyal ones, that is.",	"m6f":"filename_of_object",	"m6s":"With continuing service to COMPNOR and the Empire, you, too, citizen, may someday merit a plaque of your own.",	"m6p":"The Empire shows its appreciation in many ways. This plaque is but one small example.",	"m6t":"COMPNOR Loyalty Plaque",	"m7d":"A local school teacher wants to present a class of young students with COMPNOR badges. They reward students who memorize the COMPNOR creed. Could you deliver these badges? Children are the Empire's future, after all. ",	"m7l":"Small sealed container",	"m7o":"COMPNOR",	"m7r":"The children will be delighted. Hail the Empire and COMPNOR.",	"m7f":"filename_of_object",	"m7s":"Evidently no student successfully memorized the entire COMPNOR creed, so no badges were awarded at this time. This is acceptable; there are always more children.",	"m7p":"Nothing inspires a person more than happy, loyal children. Wouldn't you agree, citizen?",	"m7t":"COMPNOR School Badges",	"m8d":"A citizen has organized Neighborhood Rebel Alert Watches. We are so impressed with this that we've decided to adopt a similar model all across this sector. Please deliver this holocam recording to this model citizen. It's a personal thanks from our Chairman. We want loyal citizens to know they are treasured.",	"m8l":"Datadisc",	"m8o":"COMPNOR",	"m8r":"Oh goodness, a personal thanks for me? I was just doing my civic duty. Thank you.",	"m8f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m8s":"The Neighborhood Rebel Watch Alert program will go worldwide shortly.

Are you happy?",	"m8t":"COMPNOR Holocam Thank-You",	"m9d":"We offered a reward to a loyal citizen for years of service, and the citizen asked for a replica ISB uniform. We've cleared it with our superiors and need you to deliver the uniform. I must admit, our uniforms are quite sharp.",	"m9l":"ISB Uniform",	"m9o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m9r":"I can't wait to try this on. My mate will be quite enthused to see me, I think. Thank you.",	"m9f":"filename_of_object",	"m9s":"Of course the replica ISB uniform cannot be worn in public, on pain of prosecution for impersonating an officer. Did you inform the citizen of this vital fact?",	"m9p":"The Empire knows that style and fashion are important. We're glad to see others agree.",	"m9t":"Replica ISB Uniform",	"m10d":"Concerned citizens are staging a public rally to denounce the Rebellion and support the Empire. Deliver this miniature holoprojector to their leader. It will display recordings of heroic Imperial soldiers, as well as tasteful images of the atrocities perpetrated by Rebel terrorists. ",	"m10l":"Small projector",	"m10o":"COMPNOR",	"m10r":"This will make our rally so much better. Bless the Empire!",	"m10f":"filename_of_object",	"m10s":"Thank you, citizen.

It would look good on your record.",	"m10t":"Miniature Holoprojector",	"m11d":"A group of children will be marching in a local parade honoring the Emperor.

Any official can take this to the local Imperial depot to request these materials.  ",	"m11l":"Datadisc",	"m11o":"COMPNOR",	"m11r":"Our children will look so sharp. They will be a credit to the Empire.",	"m11f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m11s":"Did you inform the organizers that firing the toy blasters can, in certain circumstances, blind or maim the target? This is a design flaw that will be corrected in later versions.",	"m11p":"We admire the children's enthusiasm. If only all citizens were so enthusiastic, the galaxy would be a better place.",	"m11t":"Toy Blaster Requisition",	"m12d":"We've heard that the loyal local citizens are putting on a parade in honor of the Emperor. We're recording this event for HoloNet broadcast. Deliver this requisition order for five RMD-20 monitoring droids to this group's representatives. They can take it to their local Imperial depot to get the droids. ",	"m12l":"Datadisc",	"m12o":"COMPNOR",	"m12r":"These droids will come in handy. Our children will be so pleased when this is recorded for all the Empire to see!",	"m12f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m12s":"The assigned monitor droids are currently in use at local cantinas, but they should be available in time for the parade. Fine work, citizen!",	"m12p":"Let these children be an example to you, citizen. Strive to serve the Empire.",	"m12t":"Monitor Droid Requisition",	"m13d":"Someone has been defacing Imperial statuary. The vandals don't appear on our monitoring devices. We suspect some form of holoshroud. Deliver this new neuro-sensor to our agent. It should detect holoshrouds. We will discover the vandals and put a stop to them.",	"m13l":"Scanner device",	"m13o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m13r":"I'll catch these vandals one way or another. This device will be an immense help.",	"m13f":"filename_of_object",	"m13s":"The scanner has not yet detected the distinctive holoshroud radiation signature, but it is only a matter of time. What else could explain this weird phenomenon?",	"m13p":"To deface Imperial property is a serious crime. We'll make that clear to these criminals soon enough.",	"m13t":"Neuro-Sensor Scanner",	"m14d":"Rebel spies stole a loyal citizen's speeder. Due to the owner's modifications to the speeder, we caught these spies within a few hours. As a public relations gesture, deliver this Corporate Sector Authority voucher, which gives a generous discount on the purchase of any new swoop.",	"m14l":"Datadisc",	"m14o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m14r":"Ten percent off. Well. It sure pays to serve the Empire, huh?",	"m14f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m14s":"Well done. Spread the word of the Empire's generosity!",	"m14p":"The Empire's influence with the Corporate Sector Authority can be a great benefit to loyal citizens.",	"m14t":"Swoop Discount Voucher",	"m15d":"Our Board has selected a winner in the Patriotic Art Competition.

The documents attached include prize redemption instructions.",	"m15l":"Painting",	"m15o":"COMPNOR: Arts Division",	"m15r":"I won? I won! I can't wait to tell the kids we're going to Coruscant. Thanks!",	"m15f":"filename_of_object",	"m15s":"Plans have changed. A reliable informant tells us that the artist has been seen recently in the company of dubious individuals suspected of Rebel sympathies. The artist's prize has been cancelled. ",	"m15p":"I love the way all those children are gazing admiringly at the striking figure of Lord Vader. It's most inspiring.",	"m15t":"Lord Vader: Protector of Empire's Youth",	"m16d":"A model citizen divulged the names of several dangerous Rebel spies a few weeks ago. Two of those spies were the citizen's own parents. What greater demonstration of loyalty can exist? As we promised, we're delivering a hologram recording of the executions. Take it to this citizen with our thanks and compliments.",	"m16l":"Datadisc",	"m16o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m16r":"I don't want to watch this horrid recording! I made a big mistake! The Force preserve me! What have I done?",	"m16f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m16s":"The citizen appears to have fallen from earlier ideals and is now being taken to a COMPNOR Re-education Center. Say nothing of this, or it will go badly for you.",	"m16p":"This is the sort of strength we require in our citizens. Heed this example!",	"m16t":"Hologram of Execution",	"m17d":"Interrogation of a Rebel spy has resulted in a list of suspected Rebels and sympathizers. We're very interested in finding these individuals without alarming them.

You can never be too careful these days.",	"m17f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m17s":"Owing to the length of the list of suspects, some of those lower on the list were warned by the apprehension of the first few.

The Empire roots out such vermin wherever they nest.",	"m17t":"List of Suspects",	"m18d":"The New Order teaches that humans are superior to other species. A highly respected scientist is composing a definitive work to prove this. Help this effort by providing the scientist with the results of certain medical studies. These are not available on the HoloNet, of course. We don't want these delicate results to fall into the hands of enemies who would wilfully misinterpret them.",	"m18l":"Datadisc",	"m18o":"COMPNOR Science Division",	"m18r":"The medical results at last! Soon no one will doubt the physical and ethical superiority of humans.",	"m18f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m18s":"The sensitive nature of these medical results requires your discretion. Tell no one of these findings until the populace is suitably prepared for their release.",	"m18p":"Don't believe any stories you hear about vivisection. They're sheer nonsense.",	"m18t":"Medical Files",	"m19d":"One of our spies, who are everywhere, located a new Rebel terrorist cell several days ago but has not contacted us since. Deliver this datadisc and claim it confirms an order of fuel cells. If the recipient accepts the disc, our spy has been discovered. If the disc is refused, then our spy is still active but simply trying to avoid suspicion. Can you do this?",	"m19l":"Datadisc",	"m19o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m19r":"Fuel cells, huh? Sure, I'll take it. Do I need to sign anything?",	"m19f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m19s":"We have located the spy's body and are now recruiting a replacement. The setback is purely temporary.",	"m19p":"We lose good lives to these Rebel scum all the time. It's part of the sacrifice every good citizen must make.",	"m19t":"Confirm Status of Spy",	"m20d":"A concerned parent believes local schoolchildren are being fed pro-Rebel propaganda.

I believe all our schoolteachers harbor pro-Rebel sentiments. I'll put an end to their crimes.",	"m20f":"filename_of_object",	"m20s":"A purge and purification of schoolteachers will begin soon. Thank you for your help.",	"m20p":"How foolish of a schoolteacher to push traitorous propaganda on our children!",	"m20t":"Undetectable Transmitter",	"m21d":"A certain citizen may be supplying the Rebels. Deliver this cooker, saying that it's a prize in a sweepstakes. A transmitter built into the device should reveal the suspect's true loyalties.",	"m21l":"Food Cooker",	"m21o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m21r":"A new cooker? How wonderful. I just love baking for the neighborhood. Would you care for a cookie? They're fresh.",	"m21f":"crafting\station\food_tool.iff",	"m21s":"The Rebel sympathizer's seemingly innocuous front will soon crumble like those \"cookies\" that undoubtedly wind up in Rebel mouths.",	"m21p":"When will citizens realize that every action has a consequence? Crime does not pay.",	"m21t":"Bugged Cooker",	"m22d":"A citizen suspected of pro-Rebel sympathies is hosting a catered party in an effort to earn a promotion. Rebel-lovers do not deserve promotions. The party must fail. Deliver this bottle of Naboo wine; claim it's from the caterer. When the guests drink the wine, they'll become deathly ill. This will ruin that traitor's chances. Do your duty. ",	"m22l":"Bottle of wine",	"m22o":"COMPNOR",	"m22r":"Naboo wine! How nice. To think we were considering never using this caterer's services again. Thank you!",	"m22f":"filename_of_object",	"m22s":"The battle against the Rebellion must proceed on many fronts. COMPNOR is there to fight on the fields that the Army and Navy cannot reach.",	"m22p":"One should always know the source of a gift, don't you agree? Hahaha!",	"m22t":"Naboo Wine",	"m23d":"A lunatic who claims to be the Emperor continues to send HoloNet messages demanding a military escort to the market.

They shall all pay the price for their lack of vision!",	"m23f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m23s":"The lunatic continues to pester this office, most recently with orders to construct a second Death Star.

I hope this will convince that fool to cease such insane activities.",	"m23t":"Desist Order for a Lunatic",	"m24d":"The Empire is looking for people of action, not words.

I shall carry it with pride. Hail the Empire!",	"m24f":"filename_of_object",	"m24s":"The replica vibrodagger must not be worn in public, on pain of prosecution for impersonating an officer.
