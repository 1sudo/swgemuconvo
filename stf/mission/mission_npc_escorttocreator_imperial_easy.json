		"m1o":"Rebel slicers have made it necessary to hand-deliver certain communiques from Imperial Intelligence. One of our couriers was attacked by Rebel terrorists a short time ago but managed to transmit coordinates before communications were cut off. We need you to bring him, or the encoded orders, back to us.",	"m1p":"Thank the Emperor you've arrived! I managed to drive the Rebels away but was certain they'd return with reinforcements. We should get going.",	"m1u":"",	"m1c":"Well done, trusted agent. Now that the Rebels know we're using couriers to deliver orders, we may need your skills again soon.",	"m1e":"You're a dedicated servant of the Empire, citizen. These orders were of the highest priority and from Lord Vader himself. My thanks.",	"m1t":"Get the Courier Home",	"m2o":"One of our agents is carrying Corporate Sector Authority security codes. We need these codes to investigate the flow of credits to and from the CSA. We suspect that a large sum of credits has been funneled to the Rebels. We cannot risk another assassination attempt and so need you to escort our agent back here safely.",	"m2p":"Your bold approach identified you as a friend and not another assassin. We must get these codes to my superiors at once.",	"m2u":"",	"m2c":"Job well done, citizen. It's the Empire's pleasure to reward you.",	"m2e":"I don't think I would have made it without your help, citizen. The Empire appreciates your service.",	"m2t":"Secure the CSA's Security Codes",	"m3o":"An agent has vital intelligence regarding the movements of suspected Jedi, which needs to be delivered to the top ranks of Imperial Intelligence. Rebel assassins have made several attempts to eliminate our agent. You must make sure he and his information arrive here intact. ",	"m3p":"Careful, friend. Rebel snipers have been targeting me. They've kept me pinned down for the past few hours and might still be out there. But I suppose that's a chance we'll have to take. Let's go.",	"m3u":"",	"m3c":"Good. Now Imperial Intelligence will be able to hunt down those rogue Jedi. This will please the Emperor.",	"m3e":"Your reputation must precede you, citizen, for those Rebel snipers certainly seemed to make themselves scarce after you found me. I'm proud to have met you.",	"m3t":"Secure Vital Intelligence for Imperial Intelligence",	"m4o":"An engineered virus was on its way to us for use against anti-Imperial demonstrations. Our courier's party was attacked by Rebel terrorists. We do not know if anyone survived, but these were the last coordinates sent to us. Collect the virus and any survivors and bring them back to us. ",	"m4p":"Praise the Empire! You've found me! I've got the virus and all the Rebel scum who attacked us are dead. More are sure to come, however, so we should hurry.",	"m4u":"",	"m4c":"Excellent, agent. You've surpassed our expectations. This reward is but a taste of things to come if you continue serving the Empire faithfully.",	"m4e":"Thanks to you, this virus will perform the function it was engineered to do. Many Rebel sympathizers will understand what it means to betray their Emperor!",	"m4t":"Save the Deadly Virus",	"m5o":"A trusted courier was delivering a warrant and dossier on a citizen suspected of possessing Sith artifacts. We have reasons to believe that citizen is on this planet. The attacks on our courier further seem to confirm this. These coordinates are the courier's last known location. Go there and see if he still lives.",	"m5p":"I'm so pleased you've come! At first I thought you were another hired assassin and almost blasted you. I still have the dossier, so we should get going.",	"m5u":"",	"m5c":"Most excellent, agent. Now we can carry out the will of the Emperor. Your reward is well earned.",	"m5e":"Thanks, friend. It's good to know the Empire has competent fighters such as yourself working for the Emperor's glory.",	"m5t":"Collect the Emperor's Orders",	"m6o":"An Imperial courier was delivering important transfer orders when he fell victim to a vicious gang. We believe the courier was able to escape. We then received these coordinates from an unknown source, using an Imperial code. We need you to go and retrieve the courier, if he truly is alive.",	"m6p":"I was hoping my superiors got my coded message.  Sorry it was so brief, but I had only seconds to send it. Let's get out of here before that gang finds us.",	"m6u":"",	"m6c":"The Empire is grateful, agent. Your actions inspire other Imperial servants to strive harder to please their Emperor.",	"m6e":"You got me here safe and sound. I'll be sure to mention your name to my commanding officer. My thanks, friend.",	"m6t":"Recover the Courier",	"m7o":"Recently a Moff was accused of plotting to assassinate the Emperor. A special courier was delivering the arrest warrant to be served on the Moff and his family, but agents of the Rebellion attempted to waylay the courier. These coordinates are the origin point of his last transmission. Find him and provide an escort back here.",	"m7p":"It's a good thing you came when you did. I had run out of ammo, and it was only a matter of time before those Rebels caught up with me. Let's get out of here.",	"m7u":"",	"m7c":"A fine job, agent. We'll make sure this Moff pays for his traitorous act against our august Emperor.",	"m7e":"Many thanks, friend. This Moff has many friends in high places, and I was beginning to suspect my life wasn't worth a credit's purchase.",	"m7t":"Recover an Arrest Warrant",	"m8o":"Rebel scum hit one of our transport repair stations. We received a final distress signal that originated at the following coordinates. We'd like you to check this area and bring back any survivors. We need information on the Rebel strike team that pulled off this operation. ",	"m8p":"About time they sent someone. I'm the only survivor. Let's get back so I can inform my superiors and we can begin hunting these Rebel dogs.",	"m8u":"",	"m8c":"Your services to the Empire shall not be forgotten, agent. Here's your reward. Use it wisely.",	"m8e":"Thanks, friend. Sorry I was so short with you earlier. I was just mad and eager for revenge. But you're right; we need to stick together in these times.",	"m8t":"Find the Survivors",	"m9o":"An ISB interrogation compound was bombed by an X-wing patrol. We believe there were survivors, as we received a distress call that originated not far from the facility. Go to these coordinates and bring back any survivors you find. ",	"m9p":"An ally! Thank the New Order! My comlink ceased to work shortly after I sent my distress call. I was afraid that Rebel patrol would return to look for survivors. We should hurry as they still might.",	"m9u":"",	"m9c":"Thanks to your efforts, we will be able to identify the Rebel starfighters involved in this dastardly attack. The Empire is grateful. Claim your reward.",	"m9e":"I will not rest until every single one of the Rebels involved in this attack is in our custody and at my mercy. I'm not called the Professor of Pain for nothing!",	"m9t":"Rescue the Torturer",	"m10o":"One of our agents was in the process of delivering a case of durindfire gems to a loyal financier when a group of Rebels bandits attacked. Our troopers managed to kill the Rebels, but at the cost of their lives. We need you to escort our agent and those gems back to us before the Rebels can attempt another attack. ",	"m10p":"The gems are safe, but we must hurry. Getting these gems safely back to my superiors would be the best way to honor those fallen troopers. ",	"m10u":"",	"m10c":"Your efforts have benefited the Empire, agent. Gems such as these help finance the construction of our fleet. Here's your reward.",	"m10e":"You are a true champion of the Empire, friend. I hope we can work together again in the future.",	"m10t":"Rescue the Gems",	"m11o":"One of our operatives went to negotiate a deal with a swoop gang. We use these criminals to spy on the Rebels from time to time. It turns out, however, that these swoopers were actually Rebels in disguise. Our operative was taken captive but managed to escape. We need you to find him and escort him safely back to us.",	"m11p":"Those Rebels will be on us in no time. We must get moving now! I hope you're handy with that blaster.",	"m11u":"",	"m11c":"The Empire is pleased with your performance, agent, as this reward will demonstrate.",	"m11e":"Thanks, friend. Serving our Emperor is sometimes perilous but always satisfying.",	"m11t":"Rescue the Swooper Recruiter",	"m12o":"An Imperial Intelligence agent was escorting a valuable Kubaz spy to a nearby garrison when the spy was killed by a Rebel sniper. The Imperial agent sent a distress call and has been exchanging blaster fire with the sniper for over thirty minutes. You must hurry to these coordinates and rescue the agent. Returning here would be best.  ",	"m12p":"You might want to identify yourself next time, friend. I almost blasted you. The sniper ceased firing about ten minutes ago. It's been awfully quiet. I think I got the Rebel dog. Let's get out of here. Lead on!",	"m12u":"",	"m12c":"Mission accomplished, agent. It's too bad you couldn't verify the sniper's death. We'll send patrols out to search the area for bodies.",	"m12e":"That Kubaz was valuable to us. Those Rebels will pay for murdering him. Death to all Rebels!",	"m12t":"Retrieve the Kubaz Spy",	"m13o":"An Imperial convoy transporting hibridium ore was destroyed by Rebel saboteurs. Fortunately our cloaking device engineer, who was supervising the operation, survived the attack and has sent us a distress call. Go to these coordinates and make sure the engineer is returned safely to us. ",	"m13p":"Over here! Thank the Empire you've arrived. We lost an entire shipment of hibridium, no thanks to those Rebel scum. We'll make them pay. Let's go.",	"m13u":"",	"m13c":"This engineer is very valuable to us, agent. The Empire is grateful for his safe return. Claim your reward. ",	"m13e":"This has inspired me to try and create cloaking devices for smaller land-based speeders and transports. Thanks, friend.",	"m13t":"Retrieve the Engineer",	"m14o":"The Rebels attacked one of our water-processing plants, on the pretext that we were drugging the water supply. One of our chief chemists was making an inspection of the plant at the time. Miraculously he escaped harm by hiding inside a reinforced tank. Right now he's trying to get out of the area. Go and collect him so we can begin our investigation.",	"m14p":"Those damn Rebels! Someone on the inside must have tipped them off. How else could they know we were introducing sedatives into the water supply?",	"m14u":"",	"m14c":"Good work, agent. We will begin our investigation immediately. This is for your time and effort.",	"m14e":"Thank you for your help. I suppose we'll have to up the dosage to keep these people pacified.",	"m14t":"Rescue the Chemist",	"m15o":"An agent was dispatched to investigate rumors of Jedi activity. Not only did he witness a Jedi in action against a swoop gang, he also briefly engaged the Jedi in combat. Fortunately for our agent, the sudden appearance of more swoopers distracted the Jedi. You must go to these coordinates and escort our agent back here safely. ",	"m15p":"I must get word of this to Imperial Intelligence at once. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would not have believed it. The Empire has very good reason to worry about these Jedi.",	"m15u":"",	"m15c":"We will inform the Inquisitorius of your actions. I'm certain they will wish to call upon your services again in the future. Here is your reward.",	"m15e":"Thanks, friend. Keep your eyes open for more Jedi activity. Report anything you encounter, even rumors, to Imperial Intelligence at once.",	"m15t":"A Jedi Witness",	"m16o":"One of our couriers was shot down by Rebels but managed to survive the crash-landing. He transmitted his coordinates to us before going down. He carries important communiques from Lord Vader warning of a possible Rebel attack on the Fondor shipyards. Go and retrieve our courier or the communiques and return here.",	"m16p":"I'm battered but basically intact. We should get going, though. The Rebels that shot me down might return to make sure they got the job done.",	"m16u":"",	"m16c":"Well done, agent. These communiques were of the greatest importance. We shall send Lord Vader word of your deeds. You've earned this reward.",	"m16e":"Many thanks, friend. Have you ever considered becoming an Imperial courier? Seems like your skills would be suited to that prestigious position.",	"m16t":"Recover Lord Vader's Orders",	"m17o":"An undercover agent acquired the coordinates to a Rebel colony that houses many high-profile Rebel leaders and their families. As he was about to rendezvous with a Star Destroyer, the hated Rogue Squadron crippled our agent's shuttle. He used an escape pod to evade destruction and landed near here. Go and recover him before the Rogues finish the job.",	"m17p":"I still have those coordinates! Let's get moving. I'm banged up but I can still run. Hurry!",	"m17u":"",	"m17c":"Now we will be able to dispense some long overdue Imperial justice to these Rebels. Good work, agent. Claim your reward.",	"m17e":"Much appreciated, friend. Those Rebels will rue the day I escaped their lethal ambush. ",	"m17t":"Secure Important Coordinates",	"m18o":"A team of Army engineers went into the wilderness to test some new prototype walker. They were due back hours ago. Nothing on the comm. I suggest you get out to their coordinates and herd them in.",	"m18p":"We had an operational contingency. The walker disintegrated. I'm the only survivor. I can't say any more until I debrief my commander.",	"m18u":"",	"m18c":"Oh, fine. One more walker gone. I hope we don't find the main Rebel base soon, because we're not even remotely ready for a full assault.",	"m18e":"A certain number of contingencies are to be expected in the development of new hardware. I don't see why one explosion would damp the Empire's enthusiasm.",	"m18t":"AT-AT Walker Engineer Walking",	"m19o":"Some local do-gooder is making noise because our artillery practice destroyed some of his livestock. Boo-hoo. We sent a squad out to his farm to teach him some manners. They haven't reported back, but one agent's distress beacon went off. Check out the coordinates and bring back any survivors.",	"m19p":"It was a trap! My squad surrounded the farmhouse. I happened to be hanging back from the doorway because I stopped to take potshots at the farmer's vaporators. When my unit broke down the do-gooder's door, a booby-trap blew up the house and the whole squad! I got out on foot, because the vehicles were torched.",	"m19u":"",	"m19c":"These Rebels are getting more desperate by the day. If they're destroying their own homes to get us, they must be truly scared. Be proud you're on the winning side!",	"m19e":"I don't know why I shot those vaporators. I guess I should be glad I did. Sometimes petty vandalism can keep you alive.",	"m19t":"Imperial Artillery Specialist Stranded",	"m20o":"We blew up a Rebel fuel dump. Local civilians started cleaning up the mess without permission. Intelligence says no cleanup until they've inspected the wreckage, so we sent out a squad to stop the locals. They haven't reported in. Go bring 'em back!",	"m20p":"An ambush! When we closed on the civilians, our speeders hit a mine emplacement. Then they opened fire from hard cover. I'm the only one alive! I need an escort back to my sarge.",	"m20u":"",	"m20c":"Ambush, huh? That about fits on this miserable world. Okay, get back to whatever it is you do. And keep this quiet!",	"m20e":"It's hard bringing order to the galaxy when there's so many civilians who don't like order.",	"m20t":"Fuel Dump Cleanup",	"m21o":"Some bounty hunter took a wild shot at a local businessman and winged one of our agents nearby. Imperial Security is making a full investigation with the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and you can be sure someone's Guild license is about to expire, hard. But we need someone to get the wounded agent.",	"m21p":"I did some first aid, and I'm feeling better. But nobody around here would help me at all. It makes me angry when the locals treat us like we're the villains!",	"m21u":"",	"m21c":"Word is, they've identified the bounty hunter and put out a bounty on him. That's a nice irony. Thanks for the retrieval.",	"m21e":"These local civilians should be glad the Empire is here, keeping the streets safe from scum like that bounty hunter!",	"m21t":"Bounty Hunter's Near-Miss Needs Pickup",	"m22o":"These Rebels are crafty. They infiltrated a covert agent into one of our loyalty enforcement squads. When the squad was about to demolish the house of some old local woman, the Rebel broke cover and destroyed our squad. One of our people escaped and is stranded in what is clearly enemy territory. The rescue falls to you!",	"m22p":"That Rebel was an amazing shot. Took out five of us, bam-bam-bam, in about six shots. Pushed me into a ditch. The fall knocked me out. I'm still woozy.",	"m22u":"",	"m22c":"The Imperial Security Bureau will certainly be interested in this evidence of porous recruitment procedures. Good work!",	"m22e":"I can't even remember why we had to destroy that old woman's house. She didn't look like much threat. But then, those Rebels hardly ever do.",	"m22t":"Survivor of Undercover Agent's Betrayal",	"m23o":"Following orders from Imperial Intelligence, we sent a loyalty enforcement squad to destroy a local leader's home. Due to a mischievous slicer's alteration of message data, we inadvertently assaulted a covert Imperial Security Bureau installation. They returned fire, and both sides were wiped out save for one survivor. You need to make the rescue.",	"m23p":"We knew something was wrong when a protocol droid shouted, \"Hahaha, you lame suckers!\" Then we checked the credentials on the bodies. Oops!",	"m23u":"",	"m23c":"Good work. Remember, we have jurisdiction to recover and debrief the survivor. Ignore any ISB claims otherwise.",	"m23e":"What can I say? We were following orders. The orders don't say across the top, \"This order hopelessly messed up by villainous data slicers, so you'd be a total idiot to follow it!\"",	"m23t":"Rebel Slicer Misdirected Recon Squad",	"m24o":"The Corporate Sector Authority requisitioned more prisoners for conscript labor. We dispatched a carrier of prisoners to the spaceport, but it hasn't reported. The tracking beacon showed the vehicle moved out to the wilderness. Then it went silent. Check it out. Move!",	"m24p":"I'm the last surviving guard. The prisoners improvised a weapon and got the drop on us. They hijacked the speeder, dumped me here, and destroyed the tracking beacon. I need you to take me back to report.",	"m24u":"",	"m24c":"Another prisoner revolt. We have to get more funding for security. We're looking like amateurs!",	"m24e":"Thanks. I hate it when prisoners revolt. \"Revolting\" is the word for CSA conscripts, all right.",	"m24t":"CSA Conscript Vehicle Missing",	"m25o":"An undercover agent has information on local business people and their family members. We've arranged a rendezvous in the remote wilderness to avoid detection. To avoid suspicion when traveling with you, he's been instructed to change into an Imperial uniform. Escort him here, and avoid blowing cover at all costs.",	"m25p":"The Alliance is making headway in recruiting local business leaders. I've got data here worth a pretty credit to your superiors.",	"m25u":"",	"m25c":"Thanks. We'll have the agent interrogated too, just so we don't miss anything. Sometimes these agents like to play both sides against the middle.",	"m25e":"Hey, why is he looking so threatening? Doesn't he know I'm on his side?",	"m25t":"Rendezvous with Undercover Informant",	"m26o":"Got a report of another prisoner labor gang rioting and killing the guards. One survivor. Go and bring the guard here for debriefing.",	"m26p":"They stole a blaster and used it to blow up a transport. The explosion took out most of my unit, and they got the rest of us while we were surprised. It was awful.",	"m26u":"",	"m26c":"These riots are getting more frequent. Shows a lack of alertness training among new guard recruits.",	"m26e":"I guess they didn't kill me because I used to give them extra water. The other guards called me soft for that. Huh.",	"m26t":"Prisoner Riot Leaves Wounded Guard Alive",	"m27o":"The Emperor ordered the assassination of a treasonous Imperial dignitary. We sent an agent to do the deed using a Scarab assassin droid. But the droid went crazy, and the agent is stranded in the middle of nowhere. It's your job to make the rescue.",	"m27p":"That droid hit some kind of radioactive mineral deposit and bam! It started firing at me! Blew up my speeder before I could bring it down. I'm glad you're here.",	"m27u":"",	"m27c":"Never send a droid to do a Star Destroyer's job, I say. Your service to the Empire is noted.",	"m27e":"I usually have much better luck with Scarab models. I can requisition another if I can line up another job. Need anyone assassinated?",	"m27t":"Scarab Assassin Droid Malfunction",	"m28o":"We located -- well, we thought we located -- a Bothan SpyNet installation, an op-front. The cover was a rural HoloNet receiver. Headquarters sent a squad to storm the house, but it was a trap. We need you to survey the damage and bring back survivors.",	"m28p":"A droid saw us and said, \"Oh dear.\" It turned and stumbled away. For kicks, somebody shot the droid. It fell over onto some kind of switch. Next thing -- boom! I was the only one outside the blast radius. I need you to escort me back to report.",	"m28u":"",	"m28c":"I tell you, Bothans are the most cunning creatures in the galaxy. Makes me shiver to think we're supposed to eradicate that SpyNet, and all the time the Bothans are listening to our every word.",	"m28e":"I sure hope that in the future, HQ doesn't jump at every Bothan SpyNet eradication operation. That's what I hope.",	"m28t":"Bothan SpyNet Base Assault Gone Wrong",	"m29o":"That traitorous defector Crix Madine is leading more Rebel raids against the very soldiers who once fought beside him. Makes my blood burn. We've just got word that one of his covert strike teams blew up a listening post in the wilderness. Go out and bring back the survivors for debriefing.",	"m29p":"The Rebels lured us out in a classic decoy-and-close maneuver. Right out of Imperial small-formation tactics. I can't believe we fell for it. I'm the only one left. Can you escort me back to my dispatch point?",	"m29u":"",	"m29c":"That sounds like Crix Madine, all right. There's a special interrogation droid waiting for that man when we finally catch him.",	"m29e":"I don't think we ever saw Crix Madine himself, but I'm pretty sure someone good was handling Rebel tactics today.",	"m29t":"Madine's Covert Team Strikes Again",	"m30o":"The Empire has been looking for the Procurement and Supply base used by the Rebel leader known as Targeter. Our scout reported a sighting of Targeter's forces at rest, but then something jammed the signal. Check the coordinates of the last transmission and escort the scout back here. Don't waste time!",	"m30p":"I was looking through my electrobinocs when something big moved in front of me. Before I could look up, wham! When I woke up, I was alone. I need you to escort me back to operations.",	"m30u":"",	"m30c":"That Targeter is supposed to have unusually good recon. Maybe some special kind of droid? But we'll sneak up on that Rebel someday, count on it.",	"m30e":"I'm looking forward to debriefing. With the data from my report, I expect we can close in on Targeter before long.",	"m30t":"Imperial Scout Found Targeter Base?",	"m31o":"Imperial Intelligence put us onto a Rebel research facility. We carried out the assault beautifully, if I do say so. But we just got a call that some knucklehead trooper got left behind. I don't really care about one stupid agent, but go and bring back the idiot before some Rebel gets his hands on our gear.",	"m31p":"We were moving into the base when this weird-looking X-Wing swooped out past us. The backwash knocked me out, and when I woke up, everyone was gone and the base was destroyed. I lost all my directional gear, so I'm glad you're here.",	"m31u":"",	"m31c":"That's fine. I'll give this nincompoop a good talking-to, and then he'll be one more warm body for detention-cell duty.",	"m31e":"I couldn't help what happened. I'm not an idiot, just unlucky.",	"m31t":"Straggler from Rebel Research Base Assault",	"m32o":"A probe droid spotted a refueling base used by the Rebel starfighter unit called Rogue Squadron. We hit it hard and took it out. But in all the smoke, some dimwit agent of ours went missing. Now we've got his distress call to handle, and I don't have the time. Get this dolt back here safely, okay?",	"m32p":"The smoke was everywhere, and my IR heatsights fritzed out. I kept calling for help over the comm, but nobody showed up. They just left me! After you escort me back, I'm gonna let fly at someone, you watch.",	"m32u":"",	"m32c":"That's all I need, more namby-pamby agents moaning about being left behind. It's war! Live with it!",	"m32e":"My squad never liked me. They treated me like some, some -- droid! I'm filing a report that'll raise blisters on their collective backside.",	"m32t":"Leftovers from Assault on Refuel Base",	"m33o":"We found a Rebel facility housing fugitive Wookiees from a failed slave revolt on their homeworld, Kashyyyk. We wiped out the facility without much problem, but in the assault we lost track of a reconnaissance agent. Round up the straggler so Imperial Intelligence can complete its debriefing.",	"m33p":"It was horrible. Those Wookiees are savage killers, just like you've always heard. I found some evidence in the wreckage that may interest the Security Bureau.",	"m33u":"",	"m33c":"That evidence should help us track and close down the \"Cloaking Transit\" network that smuggles Wookiee rabble-rousers off Kashyyyk. Good work!",	"m33e":"It's only a matter of time before Kashyyyk is completely subdued, no matter how savage its natives can be.",	"m33t":"Assault on Wookiee Fugitives Left One Behind",	"m34o":"Our speeder convoy was ferrying bacta tanks to a supply post when Rebels attacked. One survivor has called in, asking for an escort back here. If you can take care of the retrieval, that's less hassle for me while I work out where to get new bacta.",	"m34p":"I got wounded in the attack, but then bacta splashed all over me when a tank ruptured. Now I feel fine. I need you to escort me back so I can report.",	"m34u":"",	"m34c":"We've lined up a backup bacta shipment from off-world. Those Rebels ought to know by now they'll never break the Empire's supply chains!",	"m34e":"The Rebels seemed just as dismayed as we were when that bacta tank ruptured. But they got away with the other tanks. I expect we'll see it on the black market soon.",	"m34t":"One Survivor from Bacta Convoy",	"m35o":"An ace pilot from a top TIE squadron has arrived on the planet. I have secret orders for his team. I need you to rendezvous and escort him to me. Be wary. Criminals and Rebel spies are everywhere.",	"m35p":"You're my contact? Nice. I thought I rated higher than some half-trugut lackey. Well, lead on.",	"m35u":"",	"m35c":"We meet again, captain. Charming as always, I see.",	"m35e":"Thanks for the escort, junior. Me and Captain Blasterbritches have some work to do now, so run along.",	"m35t":"Rendezvous with an Ace TIE Pilot",	"m36o":"One of the few survivors of the Yavin disaster is on the planet to give me a secret deposition. This could be an important step in my career. Make sure no one causes any trouble on the way. Arm yourself, just in case.",	"m36p":"Are you the person I'm supposed to give a deposition? Are you sure? Because I'll tell you everything. You sure you don't want to hear it?",	"m36u":"",	"m36c":"This secret deposition will earn me a promotion for sure. Thanks for your help.",	"m36e":"Secret? Was this supposed to be secret information? Because I told the whole story on the public transport from Togoria. There was a Twi'lek on board who sounded very interested. Is that bad?",	"m36t":"Escort a Yavin Survivor",	"m37o":"I need you to bring a captured traitor to me. The bounty hunter put a slave transmitter in his neck and dropped him off at these coordinates. Don't worry. One false move and the transmitter will explode, so he shouldn't cause you any problems.",	"m37p":"I promise not to tell anyone if you remove my slave transmitter. No? It was worth a try. Let's go, then.",	"m37u":"",	"m37c":"I told you there wouldn't be any trouble. The Empire will reward you generously.",	"m37e":"So if I just run for it right now, my head will explode? Just checking. It doesn't hurt to ask.",	"m37t":"Escort a Captured Traitor",	"m38o":"We brought in an expert scout from Lambda Sector to assist us with a few operations, but he's already gotten himself lost. Can you find this laserbrain and point him back to me? I've got a few choice words I need to convey.",	"m38p":"Hey, you found me! Well, um, thank goodness. I kinda thought my superiors had forgotten about me. Let's go.",	"m38u":"",	"m38c":"So this is the \"expert scout,\" eh? I can spot a fake just by looking at him. We'll see what his commander in Lambda Sector has to say about this.",	"m38e":"I wasn't lost! I was, um, scouting new paths across unfamiliar terrain. I'd better get back out there and check my markers. There's wild animals in that area, you know.",	"m38t":"Find a Lost Scout",	"m39o":"I know this isn't a pleasant assignment, but we just commissioned a nerf herder into the military. The Corvette Intruder has need of a junior officer. Can you bring the herder to me? Some hygienic adjustment is in order before deployment.",	"m39p":"Why don't people like us nerf herders? The smell isn't all that bad, is it? Here, smell my hand. No, really, just smell it.",	"m39u":"",	"m39c":"Let's get you a new uniform, soldier. You'll curdle the fuel cells with that reek.",	"m39e":"Come on! The smell isn't that bad. I used to work with thranta dung. You talk about stench, that stuff would singe a Wookiee's nostrils!",	"m39t":"Yes, An Imperial Nerf Herder",	"m40o":"I am scheduled to debrief a witness to possible Jedi activity. Lord Vader will want this information as soon as possible. The Jedi may know about the witness, so you must ensure that he arrives here safely. Do not delay!",	"m40p":"I'll tell the whole story in the debriefing, but I know it was a Jedi I saw. She had a lightsaber and everything. She was deflecting blaster bolts with the whole buzz! and the whoosh! thing. It was amazing!",	"m40u":"",	"m40c":"Lord Vader will be happy to hear these details. Let's get to the debriefing room, soldier.",	"m40e":"... and the Jedi hid behind a vaporator, waited for the bounty hunter to pass, and then leapt out and cut him down from behind. Unbelievable!",	"m40t":"Escort a Witness to Jedi Activity",	"m41o":"Our relay station has needed a transpacitor shunt for two weeks. Finally we get a technician ferried from Duros orbit and what happens? They dump the poor nerf in the middle of nowhere. I want you to fetch him so our relay station can get back on line.",	"m41p":"I can't believe that shuttle pilot dumped me way out here. What kind of operation do they run on this dirt ball? I'm glad at least one of you is lucid enough to solve this problem.",	"m41u":"",	"m41c":"I'm sorry for the trouble. Those gundarks in Sector Command have asteroids for brains.",	"m41e":"Thanks for the escort. Next time I come here, I'll make sure you're on the shuttle that picks me up.",	"m41t":"Fetch a Shunt Technician",	"m42o":"A blasted Rebel sniper put a laser hole in my shuttle's fuel bay. When I landed, I sent a tech with a crystal pump to clean up the acid spill. But the acid dissolved the pump's motivator and now the tech is stuck without a transport. I want you to go out there and help him get back to me. I'll see what I can do about the Rebel sniper.",	"m42p":"I'm glad you found me. I think there are Rebels out here. Let's get back so I can make a report.",	"m42u":"",	"m42c":"Rebels, you say! Tell me more. This could be the lead I require to track down that sniper.",	"m42e":"I appreciate your assistance. Now I can report about those Rebels I saw while I was out there.",	"m42t":"Assist a Shuttle Tech",	"m43o":"Look, I'll be blunt. We've had a microbial containment breach in this area. There's an expert on the planet that can set the matter straight, but there are some unsavory characters between here and there. You must fetch this expert and provide him an armed escort back to this location. You're infected now, too, so don't waste any time!",	"m43p":"I heard the report of a microbial containment breach. Take me there quickly!",	"m43u":"",	"m43c":"Well, it turns out we didn't spill a microbial solution. It was a flask of zaffa oil for my synthsteak tonight. Carry on.",	"m43e":"This agent helped me get here as fast as I could! Where is the microbial containment breach?",	"m43t":"Help an Imperial Microbe Specialist",	"m44o":"One of our patrol speeders was hit by a Rebel ambush. There's one survivor who needs rescuing right away. Get out there immediately and I'll see what I can do about providing you some aerial cover.",	"m44p":"Boy, am I glad to see you. I'm well enough to run, but we need to clear out before the Rebels come back. Let's go!",	"m44u":"",	"m44c":"I agree. That was expertly done. You'll receive a bonus for this, I assure you.",	"m44e":"I can't thank you enough for the rescue. I wouldn't have made it without you.",	"m44t":"Extract an Injured Operative",	"m45o":"One of our stealth operatives tracked a rogue transmission straight into a Rebel trap. The speeder patrols will take awhile to scramble. In the meantime, get out there as fast as you can and lend a hand!",	"m45p":"Watch out! Those Rebels are out here somewhere, and they know my blaster is drained. Let's get moving before more of them show up.",	"m45u":"",	"m45c":"Our speeder patrols bagged a few Rebel stragglers, but most of them got away. Traitorous cowards.",	"m45e":"You probably saved my life. I can't thank you enough for your help.",	"m45t":"Extract a Wounded Operative",	"m46o":"We sent the deadliest assassin under Sector Command to eliminate a threat to planetary security. Unfortunately, getting back here is not as easy as murdering someone. I want you to travel to the kill site and retrieve him at once. Hail the New Order!",	"m46p":"Oh, thank heaven! Are you here to guide me back? I'm most dreadfully embarrassed about losing my way. This usually doesn't happen to me, I assure you. Come along, then.",	"m46u":"",	"m46c":"We must be discreet. I would not presume to tarnish the reputation of Sector Command's most valuable assassin.",	"m46e":"How terribly awkward of me to lose my way like that! I certainly hope no one else will hear about my embarrassing mistake. That would vex me awfully. Is that understood, my excellent friends?",	"m46t":"Retrieve a Master Assassin",	"m47o":"I've got an embarrassing problem. One of my subordinates has fallen in with some kind of cult from the Tatooine outskirts. I want you to fetch this true believer back to me, so I can make it plain that I don't approve of \"spiritual vision quests\" on the Imperial clock. Understood? Good.",	"m47p":"Greetings, fellow spiritual traveler! Have you come to lead me home? Good. The Shrub is generous and giving to all.",	"m47u":"",	"m47c":"We'll see what \"rains down\" when Sector Command hears about this!",	"m47e":"Thank you for guiding me, fellow pilgrim! The Shrub will rain down its leaves to the willing.",	"m47t":"Retrieve a Spiritual Traveler",	"m48o":"Ever heard of an archeological engineer? Me, either, but one has been assigned to my unit. Apparently an old Vulture Droid star fighter is rotting away somewhere on the planet. This engineer of mine is investigating the site. I guess he's not good with maps, because now he needs a guide to report back to me. Please go out there and handle this. I've got more important things to worry about than droid historians.",	"m48p":"Oh good, you've come to take me back. I wandered away from the wrecked Vulture Droid and seem to have lost my way. I've got a lot to report to my superiors.",	"m48u":"",	"m48c":"I've just been ordered to put you on a transport, engineer. Someone named Lord Vader has heard of your work and wants to discuss the future of your research.",	"m48e":"Thank you. I've got much to report. If my theories are correct, the Trade Federation's droid armies played a much larger role in the creation of the Empire than has previously been suspected.",	"m48t":"Assist a Droid Historian",	"m49o":"I've got an Imperial biologist in the field investigating a possible kouhun infestation. But someone short-circuited the maintenance droids at my shuttle depot an hour ago. I can't call for an extraction. I need you to escort the biologist back here. Make sure you take a weapon. You don't want to meet one of those assassin bugs unarmed.",	"m49p":"Ow. I got a little insect bite here. I think a kouhun might have stung me. I need to get medical attention as soon as possible.",	"m49u":"",	"m49c":"How convenient that our shuttle depot was sabotaged when this \"biologist\" had a perfect alibi. Come with me, professor, and we'll get to the bottom of this.",	"m49e":"Thanks for bringing me back. But you know what? I'm not dead, so it couldn't have been a kouhun that stung me. Maybe a mace fly or a shauput.",	"m49t":"Assassin Bugs On the Loose",	"m50o":"We put a tracer beacon on the ship of a suspected smuggler. I sent an operative out to track it down. He found the ship, but it had jettisoned its cargo. I need you to find our man in the field and help him search in a line from his position to this position. You should find some contraband along the way so we can lock this smuggler up once and for all.",	"m50p":"There you are. I'm afraid I had to let the suspect and his ship go. No evidence to hold him. But let's search for that jettisoned cargo between here and my superior. Maybe we'll get the guy yet.",	"m50u":"",	"m50c":"We'll keep an eye on this Twingo creep. He's bound to make a mistake soon.",	"m50e":"I could have sworn he jettisoned his contraband somewhere out there. Guess I was wrong. Thanks for the help.",	"m50t":"Help Apprehend a Smuggler"
