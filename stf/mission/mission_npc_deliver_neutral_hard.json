		"m1o":"As I'm a specialist, my services aren't cheap, so I was surprised when a customer asked me to repair a simple mouse droid. Must mean a whole lot to this client -- my bill will likely exceed the cost of the droid. Do you think you could pick it up for me?",	"m1p":"Here he is. Tell the technician that money is no object.

This should settle everything.",	"m2i":"Last Will and Testament",	"m2f":"mission\mission_datadisk.iff",	"m2t":"Being of Sound Mind",	"m3o":"I'm under investigation for suspected Rebel activity.

Could you pick up his new doc for me? ",	"m7p":"Citizens should be more careful with these. Haven't you ever heard of identity theft?",	"m7c":"Thanks.

I've located an old hologram recording of the event that proves this. Think you could pick it up for me?",	"m8p":"This is a multi-generational copy so the quality is not so good.

Thank you!",	"m14i":"Bith Musician Memorabilia?",	"m14f":"filename_of_object (Small sealed container)",	"m14t":"Last Gasp",	"m15o":"Messages transmitted within the Hutt criminal empire use unique codes. My source has cracked one code. Please get that data, but keep it quiet!",	"m15p":"With this code my client can stop most of the Hutt criminal traffic in this sector. I hope so.
