Good job.",	"m3s":"The entire engineering team's work on this project was adequate. You are thanked accordingly.",	"m3t":"War, What is it Good For?",	"m4d":"Imperial Survey has informed us that we now have funding to begin construction on a new series of industrial mining droids. You will be constructing this prototype part, used in the droids' plasma drills. You are expected to complete this assignment quickly and efficiently.",	"m4p":"Building parts for mining droids, are you? Here are the components you've been authorized.",	"m4r":"Interesting how Imperial Survey always seems to have the resources for the equipment they need. I'd better get this droid finished before they come looking for it.",	"m4s":"Your service to the Empire has been noted. Payment has been deposited.",	"m4t":"More Mining Droids Needed",	"m5d":"You are assigned construction of a part to be used in equipment so classified that even the scientists designing it aren't sure what it's for.

Deliver it to these coordinates when you've completed assembly, and be circumspect about it. ",	"m5r":"Did you observe anything unusual in the course of creating this item? No? Excellent. You are dismissed.",	"m5s":"The discretion of all involved in this project has been noted. You are now ordered to forget anything you may recall about this assignment.",	"m5t":"Don't Ask, Don't Tell",	"m6d":"Every part in an inertial compensator needs to be made with the utmost care, due to the immense amount of stress put upon it. Construct your part of this important piece of equipment with that in mind.",	"m6p":"Did they give you the speech about the \"utmost care\"? Yeah, like you guys are usually so slipshod in your construction. Don't worry about it, he just likes the sound of his own voice. Here are the components you need.",	"m6r":"This is the completed piece? I'll put it with the others and put together the unit later.",	"m6s":"Your participation in this project is now complete, and you are to be commended for your diligence.",	"m6t":"Assemble This Carefully",	"m7d":"Imperial Security is having us build parts for a new, more sensitive security scanner. The part you have been assigned was completed incorrectly by the previous engineer. I encourage you to finish your work quickly, as all the other pieces have been turned in.",	"m7p":"I thought these components had already been put together. None of my business, I suppose. Your orders check out.",	"m7r":"I hope you did a better job with this part than your predecessor. Yes, that does seem to be the case.",	"m7s":"Imperial Security has determined that the delay in the completion of this project was not directly attributable to you. Payment has been made.",	"m7t":"Clean Up a Mess",	"m8d":"Security is being tightened throughout the Empire. This means we must keep replacement parts for an array of security devices at all times. Go and get the components for the assigned part, manufacture it, and you will be informed of where to deliver it.",	"m8p":"Parts for security devices? More like random \"crucial parts\" to pad the security budget. Not that you heard that from me, mind you. Here are the components you need. Bring the part to these coordinates when you're finished.",	"m8r":"I understand the supply officer was speaking of things that don't concern him. I'm sure we can find him a job where he isn't so overwhelmed with free time that he tries to balance departmental budgets. I trust you won't make any such foolish mistakes.",	"m8s":"You have performed admirably, and a commendation has been added to your record praising your discretion. ",	"m8t":"Someone is Paying Attention",	"m9d":"One of the great things about Imperial technologies is how many of the parts are used in a variety of devices. Your current assignment is to build this part to be used in a hyperdrive capacitor, although it is also used in a solar ionization reactor. Go and get what you need.",	"m9p":"These components? I thought they were for bacta tank temperature controllers. Oh well. Get them assembled and over to these coordinates as soon as you can.",	"m9r":"Part for a hyperdrive capacitor? We don't need a part for a hyperdrive capacitor -- Oh, you mean this part!

",	"m9t":"Which Part Goes Where",	"m10d":"An Imperial shipyard has commissioned parts to be used in a new Star Destroyer prototype. You are charged with the production of this part, a vital component in the power coupling of a deflector shield. Go to the supply officer, who will furnish you with the components you need. ",	"m10p":"So you're one of the techs working on the starship components, huh? Got the parts you need right here waiting for you. Bring 'em to these coordinates when you're done.",	"m10r":"Another part for the deflector array already? You're a fast worker. It checks out, so I guess you're done.",	"m10s":"The speed with which you have completed your assignment has been noted.",	"m10t":"Your Piece of a Star Destroyer",	"m11d":"Execute this urgent assignment with all haste. A vital part of an energy coupler cooling grid is defective. You are to replace this part with one that is functional. Build it and deliver it personally to the officer in charge. A second failure by our department would look very bad and would bode poorly for your career.",	"m11p":"I was told to have the components waiting for you. Somebody very important must want this. ",	"m11r":"What? For the energy coupler cooling grid? Too late, that grid blew sky-high. Took out a company of stormtroopers, too. Oh well, there are always more troopers.",	"m11s":"Your participation in this distasteful episode has been reviewed. You have been found innocent of wrongdoing. The commander who gave you this assignment is now undergoing appropriate discipline. That is all.",	"m11t":"Keeping It Cool",	"m12d":"The latest assignment we have received is straight from the Imperial Department of Military Research. All you need to know is that you will be building this small part used in a discharge modulator.

Bring your completed part to these coordinates when you have finished its construction.",	"m12r":"Very well, your task has been discharged, and you are free to continue with other projects.",	"m12s":"Everything was turned in on schedule and within acceptable construction parameters. Payment has been authorized.",	"m12t":"A Cog in a Machine",	"m13d":"You are required to aid completion of a new model of beamdrill. These drills are vital to the resource-gathering abilities of the Empire. Therefore, treat this seemingly lowly assignment with the same reverence you would give to parts for a TIE fighter. Collect your components and deliver your completed part.",	"m13p":"It looks like you're building a part for some kind of engine. Everything you need is right here. If you need anything else, bring me proper authorization and it's yours.",	"m13r":"We've been making a lot of these drills lately. Imperial Survey must have found a major new source of minerals somewhere.",	"m13s":"Imperial Survey was very pleased with our work on the new drills. Congratulations are sent to all teams who worked on them.",	"m13t":"The Importance of Drilling in Earnest",	"m14d":"Exciting new advances have been made in power carrier pulse generators. This department is implementing this new technology. You have the honor of assembling an important part for the prototype. Make the Empire proud!",	"m14p":"I just need to double-check your identification. It's routine on such an important project. All in order, and I believe these are the components assigned to your project. Deliver the completed part to these coordinates.",	"m14r":"Good, you're here. These new pulse generators are going to make the old ones seem antiquated by comparison! ",	"m14s":"The new generators are 15% less efficient than the old models. This was evidently due to a design flaw rather than poor construction. These results are now classified. Tell no one.",	"m14t":"On the Cutting Edge",	"m15d":"An Imperial Star Destroyer in orbit requires replacement parts for one of the docking suspension field projectors. You are instructed to complete this part in a timely fashion. It would be the height of foolishness to annoy the captain by dawdling.",	"m15p":"These are the components you need. A pity you don't get to deliver the completed part to the ship personally. That would be something to see.",	"m15r":"I'd better get these up to the ship right away. The captain is not a patient man.",	"m15s":"The arrival of your part proved timely. The captain was on the verge of executing an innocent bystander. You have done well.",	"m15t":"This is a Rush Order",	"m16d":"All the systems that make up an Imperial cruiser are vital. Therefore, this assignment -- to make a replacement part for a garbage disposal unit -- is vital. If you have a problem with that, pretend you're making something for one of the blaster cannons.",	"m16p":"Here are the components on your manifest. Don't feel bad -- the galaxy needs garbage disposal too. The installation engineer is waiting for your part at these coordinates.",	"m16r":"That's what I was waiting on. Don't feel too bad; the technician before you had to make a part for the toxic waste disposal system.",	"m16s":"Every part on a vessel is considered to be of equal importance. To question this is to question Imperial leadership.",	"m16t":"We're All Equal in the Eyes of the Empire",	"m17d":"Congratulations, you have been chosen to work on a highly classified project. You do not have the security clearance to know what you are making parts for, but be assured that they are imperative to the cause of our beloved Emperor. Make this part and secure your place in Imperial history. ",	"m17p":"This is a set of \"priority\" components. There will be no record of these components, nor of the part you construct. Bring it to this location once complete.",	"m17r":"I trust you spoke of this part to no one. Excellent. Go about your business as though this never occurred.",	"m17s":"A small number of credits have been added to your account. This is a random bonus and was not earned for any services.",	"m17t":"As Though It Never Happened",	"m18d":"The Imperial Department of Military Research is improving old droid technology. We have been given a schematic for a new prototype. You are assigned the task of creating this component. Head to supply and get the components you need.",	"m18p":"You must be quite well respected to be working on a project like this. Here are your components; bring them to these coordinates when you've finished.",	"m18r":"Good work. At this rate we'll have this droid assembled in no time.",	"m18s":"Due to the untimely demise of the field test team, this project has been shelved until the aggression circuits have been redesigned.",	"m18t":"Still Need to Work out a Few Details",	"m19d":"You build things, correct? Excellent. Heed my instructions: You are to build an essential part to be used for diagnostics of the next Imperial Star Destroyer tractor beam system. Yes, I thought you'd be flattered. Go.",	"m19p":"Tractor beams can be difficult. This device will ensure that the beam works effectively without shaking the target to bits. Deliver your completed part to these coordinates.",	"m19r":"For the tractor beam diagnostics? Very well. I shall consign the task of calibrating and diagnosing the beam's performance to some junior officer. You may go.",	"m19s":"I am informed you discharged your duty correctly. However, should the tractor beam prove unstable and destroy a target, the Empire will know who is responsible.",	"m19t":"Calibrating Tractor Beams is Such a Nuisance",	"m20d":"Ships captured by tractor beam and pulled into a Star Destroyer's main hangar are held in place with an electromagnetic paralyzing pincer crane. This office finds the state of current research in this field quite sad. For our improved crane prototype this office requires a certain part. Secure the components and build that part.",	"m20p":"Ah, excellent! This office takes the position that research in paralyzing pincer cranes is unduly neglected. Here are the components. Deliver the completed part to these coordinates.",	"m20r":"A dismal epoch in paralyzing pincer crane research will shortly end. That is my own opinion, which of course echoes that of my superiors.",	"m20s":"This office's consistent advocacy for paralyzing pincer crane research will see the Empire to still greater glory! ",	"m20t":"Paralyzing Pincer Crane Stance",	"m21d":"The Kuat shipyard is preparing a new, grander class of Imperial military cruisers. Details are classified. To train personnel for this new ship, we shall use dummy prototypes of the new equipment. We require you to build a certain part for the latest prototype. Pick up the components at once.",	"m21p":"Here are the components for the prototype part. Don't worry if it is not functional; that is not its purpose. Deliver the completed part to the personnel trainer.",	"m21r":"For a training display it is crucial that this not actually work. Let me test it -- yes! Nothing! Well done.",	"m21s":"You may rest assured that building nonfunctional equipment serves the Empire's larger purpose. Be proud, agent!",	"m21t":"We Don't Want It to Work",	"m22d":"Umm-hmm-hm -- what? You wish to build something? Ah. Well, in fact the Empire has entrusted this office to build a prototype for -- this will impress you -- a service gantryway retractor for a TIE fighter hangar. Yes, I share your obvious astonishment at this high honor. Pick up the components and build a certain part we need.",	"m22p":"What excitement I feel, giving you these components for the TIE hangar service gantryway retractor! All those years of training at the Academy have paid off. Deliver the completed part to these coordinates.",	"m22r":"It is of course a wonderful honor to assemble the new prototype service gantryway retractor. Don't tell anyone in the Empire that I ever said differently.",	"m22s":"For your worthy aid in constructing the TIE hangar service gantryway retractor, you no doubt feel the same thrill shared by all in this office. Your payment is attached.",	"m22t":"Know the Thrill of a Gantry Retractor",	"m23d":"A very high clearance project is getting under way elsewhere in the galaxy. Very high clearance. Prototype part design is being scattered across the Empire for security. It falls to you to build one particular part. It may appear innocuous, but believe me -- this is of signal importance. Pick up the components. Tell no one.",	"m23p":"We've been shipped strange components for this classified project. Very advanced. Oops, I'd better not say any more. Deliver the completed part to these coordinates.",	"m23r":"I have been informed of your assignment. I shall relay the prototype to the assembly staging area.",	"m23s":"Payment is attached. Tell no one of your work, or it will go badly for you.",	"m23t":"Part for Highly Classified Project",	"m24d":"We require you to build a part for an atmosphere processing substation. Here are the schematics. The purpose is classified, but you need to know that it is for a -- well, a large battle cruiser. A very, very large cruiser. Build the part with appropriate tolerances. Pick up the components at these coordinates.",	"m24p":"I can't believe the tolerances on these components! You'd think they were building another Death Star or something. Deliver the completed part to these coordinates.",	"m24r":"The soldier who gave you these components has been court-martialed for loose talk and removed off-world. Attempt to avoid that fate yourself.",	"m24s":"Perhaps I failed to stress the need for confidentiality in this assignment. Let that be your watchword in any Imperial assignment.",	"m24t":"Part for a Very, Very Large Cruiser",	"m25d":"This office supervises sector-wide production of landing alignment markers for spacecraft docking bays. Not glamorous, I grant you, but important. The machine that produces these parts has broken, and the replacement part is on Coruscant. We prefer to commission you to build the required part. Get the components at these coordinates.",	"m25p":"Docking bay alignment markers, eh? It never occurred to me that anyone actually needed to make those. Deliver the completed part to these coordinates.",	"m25r":"I'll dispatch this to the repair droids soon. I'd hate to cripple sector-wide production of -- um -- landing alignment markers. Heh.",	"m25s":"Citizens seldom appreciate the details involved in running a galaxy-wide Empire. You have helped with one such detail. Expect more work soon.",	"m25t":"Docking Bay Alignment is Important Too",	"m26d":"We require you to build a prototype part. Note that in this schematic it goes in an ion sublight engine. You are not to regard or comment on the unusually large size of the ion engine. You are not to speculate on the size of the craft propelled by this engine. That is classified. Pick up the components at these coordinates.",	"m26p":"Note that I am specifically not commenting on the size of the engine implied by the tolerances in these components. I am in no way violating secrecy.",	"m26r":"What is this? For an ion engine? Don't be absurd. An ion engine that needs a part like this would be big enough to move a small moon!",	"m26s":"It appears that certain members of the supply chain were not adequately briefed on security. This shortfall has been remedied. Tell no one.",	"m26t":"Who Needs an Ion Engine That Big?",	"m27d":"Restrain your excitement as I commission you to create a vital part for the prototype trash compactors aboard a space battle station now being planned. I am not clear what spacecraft these trash compactors are for. Ah well, it is not for a mere line officer to question the Empire. Pick up the components at these coordinates.",	"m27p":"The battle station in question must have unusual functions. This schematic indicates an extremely high volume of garbage. Deliver the completed part to these coordinates.",	"m27r":"This is satisfactory. Tell no one of the new prototype trash compactor, or it will go badly for you.",	"m27s":"I am belatedly informed that this matter is highly classified. Tell no one.",	"m27t":"Prototype Trash Compactor",	"m28d":"The Empire is preparing a new -- let me see here -- a new induction hyperphase generator for some sort of new battle cruiser. Prototype parts for this device are being produced all over the galaxy, for security reasons. Pick up the components and create a part for this generator. Meanwhile, I will try to identify the battle cruiser.",	"m28p":"All the tolerances for this induction hyperphase generator seem several orders of magnitude too high. Oh well. Deliver the part to these coordinates.",	"m28r":"Did anyone discuss the destination of this part? Oh, that officer did, did he? I must see about that.",	"m28s":"Attention! I have been informed, beyond any possibility of ambiguity that you are absolutely not to discuss the new battle cruiser! That is all.",	"m28t":"Some Sort of New Battle Cruiser",	"m29d":"In vain this office has tried to build an acceptable prototype for a new laser firing field amplifier. Imperial Center rejected our previous attempts as \"inadequate.\" But they will certainly accept this new design! Pick up the components at these coordinates and build a vital part for this absurdly massive device.",	"m29p":"I don't understand why our previous designs were rejected. Now this field amplifier is so ridiculously overpowered, it could have blown up Alderaan. Well, deliver the part to these coordinates.",	"m29r":"Another part for yet another field amplifier. The power tolerances required by this latest design are absolutely outlandish. Well, I shall forward your part as required.",	"m29s":"I cannot believe this! Once more Imperial Center has rejected our design as \"underpowered\"! Well, this office may contact you again with another assignment.",	"m29t":"Absurdly Overpowered Amplifier",	"m30d":"I am pleased that this office -- my office -- has received orders to construct prototype parts for the next generation of TIE Interceptor spacecraft. Thank you, thank you. But rather than dwelling on the high honor this represents, I am commissioning you to pick up components at these coordinates and build a certain vital part.",	"m30p":"Here are the components. It must be so glamorous working on the new TIE Interceptor project! Can I get your autograph?",	"m30r":"Ah, the TIE Interceptor project is already proceeding apace. This will reflect very well on us. I shall have this piece installed at once.",	"m30s":"Rather than dwell on this project's opportunities for advancement, let me congratulate you on your good fortune in becoming involved. Onward to victory!",	"m30t":"Think of the Prestige",	"m31d":"Are you skilled at microminiaturization? Well, it doesn't matter -- the prototype is one thousand times actual size.

Pick up the components at these coordinates.",	"m31p":"I wondered how a stormtrooper helmet could hold all of this equipment, until I saw the \"1000x\" on the prototype schematic. They do make things small nowadays.",	"m31r":"I'm glad this new viewplate prototype is a thousand times actual size. We built the earlier design actual size, and a soldier sneezed and destroyed it.",	"m31s":"I'm told the new viewplate prototype was rejected as \"unacceptably large.\" It seems we must try to coordinate our communications better.",	"m31t":"One Thousand Times Actual Size",	"m32d":"You have seen an Imperial AT-AT walker?

Anyway, deliver the completed part to these coordinates.",	"m32r":"Is it true? That officer referred to the AT-AT cockpit access as a \"neck\"? You're sure? Very well, I shall look into the matter.",	"m32s":"In regard to our earlier conversation, disregard all uses of the term \"neck\" to mean \"cockpit access.\" I have been authoritatively informed that this term is incorrect.",	"m32t":"Control System for AT-AT Neck",	"m33d":"The Imperial Army is redesigning the AT-ST scout walker to handle more varied terrain.
