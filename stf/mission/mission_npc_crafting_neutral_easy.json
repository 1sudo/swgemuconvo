		"m1d":"Some customer had the gall to complain about the quality of my acceleration compensators. I'll have you know they're the best in the galaxy! Well, just to be on the safe side, I made some tweaks to the design. I need you to build this part for me so I can hand it to my testing division. Take this schematic to my supplier.",	"m1p":"I kept telling the \"engineering genius\" that those designs were flawed. We'll be lucky to avoid criminal prosecution. Here's what the new schematic calls for, friend. Hope this one works. Take the finished part to our lead tester.",	"m1r":"What? Not another incarnation of the \"ultimate acceleration compensator\"? Okay, my people will get right on it.",	"m1s":"Heard everything looked pretty good, friend. Nice work. You ever consider opening a shop, you just let me know!",	"m1t":"Build a Better Valve",	"m2d":"I certainly could use your help, friend. I've received a schematic for a new MSE-6 droid motivator. I've never seen anything like it. Way too complex for a simple mouse droid, I can tell you that. Anyway, if you think you can put this part together, I'd compensate you for your time. You need to see my partner for the components.",	"m2p":"These specs are pretty sophisticated. Mouse droids don't have the computing power to take advantage of these bad boys. But it's not my project. Here you go.",	"m2r":"Thanks, friend. I know this must seem kinda strange, but trust me, it's for a good cause. Next time you see a mouse droid, don't be so quick to dismiss it.",	"m2s":"My customer was quite happy with your work, citizen. You seem to have a knack for this sort of thing. Come see me again some time.",	"m2t":"Build a Better Mouse Droid",	"m3d":"One of my buyers has had some problems with the TT-8L's optical photoreceptors. For some reason certain comlink frequencies create static in the image. An associate redesigned the optics, but I haven't assembled all the parts yet. Can you build one? Take this schematic and pick up the components from my supplier.  ",	"m3p":"I keep waiting for Serv-O-Droid to upgrade the Y7 models. I'm sure it'll happen when there's enough demand. Here you go. Take it to our disgruntled buyer when you're done.",	"m3r":"I hope this clears up the problem. Nothing is worse than having your hologram scrambled right in the middle of a really interesting encounter. Oh, I'm into, uh, private surveillance.",	"m3s":"Well done, friend. Apparently you've got the magic touch. You keep this up and you'll make a name for yourself.",	"m3t":"Build a Better Photoreceptor",	"m4d":"These owners of older-model airspeeders! All those models have defective anti-theft sensors. Either you live with the risk of your vintage vehicle being stolen, or else you get a new airspeeder. Why don't they see that? Gaah. Take yet another sensor redesign schematic to my parts supplier and assemble this part. If it doesn't work this time, I'm giving up.",	"m4p":"Well, they say third time's a charm. Or does this make five attempts? Hmm, not sure. Good luck with that.",	"m4r":"I'm certain this new design will fix the problem. Plus, I'm convinced it wasn't a fault in the design in the first place. Shoddy workmanship was to blame.",	"m4s":"With any luck, this will keep this customer off our backs. I've never understood the attraction of restoring junked airspeeders anyway. You did well, friend.",	"m4t":"Theft-Proof a Vintage Airspeeder",	"m5d":"It may not be the most difficult or prestigious engineering work in the galaxy, but building a sturdy magnetic clamp is still important work. Think you can help me get this latest design together? I need a part assembled for it. My partner just put the finishing touches on some of those components, so everything should be ready to go.",	"m5p":"I reshaped some of the widgets to be a bit more pleasing to the eye. Maybe that work is wasted on magnetic clamps, but I take pride in my work. I'm sure you understand.",	"m5r":"This is for a magnetic clamp, huh? Looks more like a sculpture. Well, as long as it works, I suppose I really don't care. Thanks.",	"m5s":"We should all take pride in our work, eh, friend? The product is delivered and the customer seems happy. I've gladly deposited your fee.",	"m5t":"Make a Nifty Magnetic Clamp",	"m6d":"These new cruiser reactors are generating too much heat. We need to constantly upgrade the coolant pumps to compensate. I wish the corporate engineers who designed these reactors worried about practical issues instead of pleasing Imperial masters. Take this new pump schematic to my supplier and build this part.",	"m6p":"Those hotshot pilots rarely take the time to appreciate the delicate inner workings of a thermal sink. Most of them just want a big on-off switch. If only it were that easy. Here you go.",	"m6r":"Nothing vexes a pilot like an overheated engine, friend. I sure hope this new design reduces such incidents. Thanks.",	"m6s":"Product was delivered and seems to work. Job well done. Enjoy your pay.",	"m6t":"Coolant Pumps Are Fun",	"m7d":"About time someone decided to take a look at these old radiation funnels. They're notorious for spewing out all sorts of noxious gases. This new design should eliminate this problem. We still have some electrocution issues to work out, but progress takes time. If you want to put some components together, pick them up from my partner.",	"m7p":"Air dissociators are tricky things to put together. The problem was not the size of the funnel but its shape. Hopefully you can solve that. Good luck.",	"m7r":"Personally, it never really bothered me that the old radiation funnels were polluting the air. Isn't it the Empire's job to worry about that sort of thing? Thanks anyway, though.",	"m7s":"Yeah, I know -- Alzoc pearls before Ugnaughts, right? But at least you built your part well and delivered it on time. Your pay has been deposited. See me again.",	"m7t":"The Beauty of a Radiation Funnel",	"m8d":"There's nothing worse than a leaky power cell. Weight is a limiting factor for any vessel, so you want to make your load as light as possible. If we could redesign these older power cells then pilots could reduce the number they need to stock to insure a safe journey. If you think you can assemble some of the components, take this schematic to my partner for the parts.",	"m8p":"The problem really only arises in the high-intensity cells. The ordinary ionized cryogenic cells are fine. In any case, good luck.",	"m8r":"So you're sure this will fix the problem, eh? Okay, I'll test it out and send reports back in. Thanks.",	"m8s":"Great! You got it there. I'll just hope for the best and see how that new power cell performs. Good work, by the way.",	"m8t":"Fix the Leaky Power Cell",	"m9d":"Power surge regulators are a crucial component of all ionization blasters. Last thing you want is your blaster overheating and frying your limbs. These regulators need to be upgraded on a regular basis, especially since the new blasters keep upping their power output. Take this regulator redesign and assemble the part I need. See my partner for the components.",	"m9p":"I've actually seen what happens when one of those babies overloads. Not pretty. Fortunately it happened to a Trandoshan, and he didn't seem to mind much. Here you go. When you're finished, drop the part off with our tester.",	"m9r":"Another power surge regulator? I sure hope this one works. I'm running out of volunteers to test these blasted things. Well, try and try again, I suppose. Thanks.",	"m9s":"Sounds like everything is in order. Good work, friend. I'm sure you've solved all those safety issues with this new redesign.",	"m9t":"Safety Is Important",	"m10d":"One of my clients is headed for Iskallon and wants to commission a custom sonic weapon.

If you think you can lend a hand, I'd reward your service. Pick up the components from my supplier.",	"m10p":"Iskallon is a water world, I believe. Makes sense. These sonic weapons are much more effective underwater. Here are the parts. When you're finished assembling the part deliver it to the customer. Good luck with it.",	"m10r":"Excellent work, citizen. I think this will aid my mission rather well. Tell the engineer I'll deliver a status report when I get back.",	"m10s":"Sounds like you did a fine job. I've deposited your fee, and I think you'll find it quite generous. I hope you look me up in the future if you need work.",	"m10t":"Sonic Weapons Are Loud",	"m11d":"A bounty hunter is not happy with the power of current wrist rockets. I don't know the target, but I've been asked to design a more effective magnetic accelerator. I've got the design but I need someone to assemble a vital part. Think you can help me out? Get the components from my associate, who specializes in magnetics. ",	"m11p":"The rockets fired by this launcher will be able to penetrate most armor, which I'm sure was the point. I just hope the power pack doesn't burn out. Take the finished part to the bounty hunter when you're done. ",	"m11r":"This might make the weapon a little bulky. I'll pay you a visit if the weapon does not perform as promised.",	"m11s":"Got that to our customer, I see. I wouldn't give too much credence to any threats that might have been sent your way. That's just standard bounty hunter talk. Thanks for your help.",	"m11t":"Build a Deadlier Wrist Rocket",	"m12d":"We get quite a few bounty hunter customers -- not surprising given the nature of their work and our discretion policy. One wants a larger stun net. I've redesigned the housing and firing mechanism to handle the larger volume. If you can assemble a part for me, I'll pay you. Get the components at these coordinates.",	"m12p":"The thinness of these new canisters worries me. They'll be easier to puncture. Drop the part off with the customer, would you? Oh, and don't mention my name.",	"m12r":"Hmm, it does seem heavier. We'll see how it performs. These nets better be strong enough to immobilize an enraged gundark, or there'll be trouble.",	"m12s":"I'm quite pleased with your handiwork, citizen. I hope this wonderful partnership continues. Enjoy your pay.",	"m12t":"Need a Bigger Stun Net",	"m13d":"Moisture farmers certainly seem to enjoy their work. Can't say as I'd find any satisfaction doing that. But I do enjoy redesigning hardware to be more efficient. This time it's a humidity sensor. Here's the schematic. Could you pick up the components at these coordinates and build the part I need?",	"m13p":"Make sure the sensor pads are wiped clean before installation. And use the C-sized hydrospanner when assembling it. The larger ones tend to scratch the pads. The eager customer waits for the finished product at these coordinates.",	"m13r":"Thank you so much. This looks great. I can't wait to assemble this new sensor. Moisture farming is such a joy, don't you agree?",	"m13s":"Looks like you made one moisture farmer very happy. Good work, friend. I've transmitted your fee. See me again if you want more work.",	"m13t":"Moisture Farming Made Easy",	"m14d":"A blaster collector has asked me to redesign the power surge dampener for the Defender sporting blaster. Apparently the goal is to make these blasters pack more of a punch. I've got the schematic here, but I need a part assembled. If you could pick up the components and take care of that, I'd pay you for your time.",	"m14p":"Why would a collector want to change the specs of an older blaster? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of collecting? Anyway, here are the parts. Drop the part off at these coordinates when you're done. Good luck.",	"m14r":"These look good, citizen. I'll start assembling the new dampener right away. I'll let our engineer know you do good work.",	"m14s":"Everything went smoothly, friend. Our blaster mechanic was impressed by you. Feel free to see me for more assignments.",	"m14t":"Upgrade the Sporting Blaster",	"m15d":"I've been asked to modify the power pack of an old beam tube.

Take the schematic with you.",	"m16p":"Bounty hunters do seem to love their disruptors. Here are the parts. When you've assembled the components, take the finished product to our weapon specialist.",	"m16r":"I've seen the redesign, citizen. Do you have any idea what the destructive capability of this weapon will be when it's assembled? I hope this bounty hunter never comes after me.",	"m16s":"Handled like a true professional, citizen. I've transmitted your pay and would gladly work with you again.",	"m16t":"One Mean Disruptor",	"m17d":"A Corporate Sector Authority security representative has asked me to increase the firepower of their Golan Arms flechette launchers.

Here are the components. Take the finished part to our specialist.",	"m17r":"This new design will easily penetrate stormtrooper armor plate. I wonder if the Empire knows the CSA is asking for these changes? Oh well. Thanks.",	"m17s":"It's important in our business to maintain confidentiality. I'm sure you understand. Good work. Your pay has been deposited.",	"m17t":"Keep This Confidential",	"m18d":"A client wants a thermal detonator with a dummy timer that sets to three seconds regardless of what the user tries to do.

If you wish to help, pick up the components at these coordinates.",	"m18p":"Doesn't sound like the client intends to use this thing himself, eh? Here are the components. I'd take extra care with assembling them, if I were you. Take the finished part to our demolitions expert.",	"m18r":"A three-second dummy timer, huh? I feel sorry for the being that tries to use this weapon. Okay, I'll take it from here.",	"m18s":"Thanks for your help, friend. I see you understand how important it is in our business to get rid of moral judgments. Come see me for more work.",	"m18t":"A Very Short Fuse",	"m19d":"When you work in my field for as long as I have, you learn not to ask questions.

He placed at the back of the pack this year at Ord Mantell, so for next year he's customizing every piece of his ship. Money is no object, he says -- music to a designer's ears! I have a schematic. I'd like you to pick up the components, make the part, and drop it off to the client's agent.",	"m37p":"Some of this stuff was hard to find, but when the money is flowing like water, I can make things happen. This is the most lucrative contract I've ever had!",	"m37r":"I'll take this part to my client at once. He's paid me well -- very well -- to get all equipment to him quickly. Thank you!",	"m37s":"You're not satisfied with your payment? Sorry. Turns out the customer went bankrupt shortly after I gave you the assignment. I'm paying you out of my own pocket. Better luck next time!",	"m37t":"Big-Money Assignment",	"m38d":"S-threads are HoloNet signals transmitted through hyperspace. A homing beacon sends coded locator signals across the HoloNet whenever the beacon crosses an S-thread. This schematic describes a part for a controller that amplifies the beacon's sensitivity a hundredfold. Get the materials and make it for me, and together we'll sell it to the Imperial Navy for a fortune!",	"m38p":"People asked an awful lot of questions when I was putting together these materials. I got the impression that the Empire doesn't like a lot of interest in S-threads. Your call, of course.",	"m38r":"You are the manufacturer of this controller part? I'll take that. The individual who was to receive this device is now in custody. Tell no one about this technology, or your life will take a sudden brief turn for the worse.",	"m38s":"Greetings. I am protocol specialist RT-3P0. My owner commissioned you to develop a part for the S-thread sensor controller. I regret to report that my owner is now in Imperial custody. I'm sure it's only temporary. I am authorized to release your payment, with my owner's fervent request that you never mention this matter again to anyone at any time hereafter, forevermore. Thank you.",	"m38t":"Improve Your Homing Beacon",	"m39d":"Please help me! I'm in trouble with a Hutt gang. They want a new thrust monitor for the repulsorlift on one of their vehicles. It's a huge luxury vehicle called a sail barge. I've spent two sleepless days finishing the schematic and lining up a supplier. You must get the materials and put together a vital part of this monitor! Please hurry!",	"m39p":"No, please, I beg of you -- uh, I mean -- wait, you're not with the Hutts, are you? The crafter! Wonderful! Please take these materials and make the piece. Hurry! Please!",	"m39r":"At last! Where have you been? Do you know what kind of threats they've been -- well, never mind. I have to hurry!",	"m39s":"All right. I believe Lord Jabba is satisfied, for the moment. I also believe it's time for me to look into other lines of work.",	"m39t":"Sail Barge Thrust Monitor",	"m40d":"Life support transponders on your typical starship are no good for low-temperature species. Some ammonia-breather from the Outer Rim is laid up here with equipment failure, and -- he? It? I couldn't tell -- needs a new transponder. This is the design for one crucial part. I've lined up the supplies you need. Will you make it for me?",	"m40p":"I never got a look at this ammonia-breathing alien. Apparently it never leaves its ship. Talks to everyone by comlink. Maybe that's just as well, huh? Must be an ugly thing.",	"m40r":"This is the piece for the transponder? All right, I'll install it and take the device to the ship airlock. Sorry, I have no idea how the creature intends to pay you.",	"m40s":"The ammonia-breather sent me some kind of odd jewels, which I've sold on the commodities market. I'm paying you good Imperial credits from my profits. Thanks!",	"m40t":"Life Support System Transponder",	"m41d":"A customer who owns a vintage SoroSuub cloud car has been having trouble with sudden gains in altitude. I spotted this at once as a problematic altimeter. You can't get standard parts for those old models any more, so I've designed a new schematic. Can you get the components and build this particular part to my order, please?",	"m41p":"Here's what you want for that altimeter piece. These owners of vintage cloud cars need to understand the importance of proper maintenance.",	"m41r":"Great! I can hardly wait to get flying again. And this time I won't have to worry about accidentally leaving the atmosphere.",	"m41s":"Thanks. I appreciate vintage vehicles as much as anyone, but if your car is threatening to leave the planet, something is wrong, right?",	"m41t":"Cloud Car Leaving Atmosphere = Bad!",	"m42d":"My grandmother is still spry after all these years. No, \"spry\" isn't the word -- try \"crazy.\" She's planning a solo jaunt across the Outer Rim in her old starship. But Grandma finds it hard to read sensors nowadays, so I've designed a better interference filter. Can you pick up the materials I ordered and build this important part for it?",	"m42p":"I've heard about this jaunting grandma. I hope the old fuselage is up to that kind of bombardment. Here. Take the completed part to my delivery agent.",	"m42r":"Is this for the old grandma? Okay, I'll ship it off right away. She's probably raring to get out into the spacelanes.",	"m42s":"I tried to politely suggest to Grandma that she take a companion on her trip. She just about bit my head off. I have to admit, I like her spirit.",	"m42t":"Grandma Hitting Spacelanes",	"m43d":"I don't know who sent me this design commission, or what device it goes into. The device induces very small current changes in delicate electrical systems. Can you get the components from my agent and put together the last part I need?",	"m43p":"Whoever wanted me to get these components for you has been very secretive. I wonder what the device is for?",	"m43r":"Is this for the gadget my mysterious correspondent has been waiting for? Ugh, it looks like the current controller on a nerve disruptor. But that's silly. I'm sure it couldn't be a torture device!",	"m43s":"Did you deliver the part safely? I still haven't learned what the device is for. I hope the anonymous customer can put it to good use.",	"m43t":"Mysterious Microcurrent Inducer",	"m44d":"I never knew this. Lamproids don't buy medical cocoons, at least not off the shelf. A Lamproid I know has been trying to get one custom-made, and I have plans here for an endocrine regulator. Can you make the particular part I need from my supplier's materials?",	"m44p":"I guess there aren't enough Lamproids in this sector to offer a lucrative market for the cocoon makers. Or else the Lamproids that are here aren't very rich.",	"m44r":"Does this go in the endocrine regulator? Excellent. I'll pass it along to my Lamproid friend. She'd take the delivery herself, but she doesn't have arms, you know.",	"m44s":"The medical cocoon is shaping up nicely. Kind of a snaky shape, actually. I appreciate your help, and so does the Lamproid!",	"m44t":"Lamproids Need Endocrine Regulators Too",	"m45d":"My latest customer was sailing along in a vintage SoroSuub cloud car, ran into heavy turbulence, and almost crashed. Turns out the car's freeze-floating control dates back to the Republic. I've adapted current designs to fit that old classic, and I need you to pick up some components and put together a particular part.",	"m45p":"Here are the materials you need for that freeze-float part. Those old cloud cars still hold up real well, but you have to keep up with scheduled maintenance.",	"m45r":"Great! I can hardly wait to get flying again. And this time I won't have to worry about downdrafts.",	"m45s":"Thank you. Not many good crafters will spend time on vintage equipment. New, new, new, that's the usual attitude.",	"m45t":"Cloud Car Falling = Bad",	"m46d":"Don't ask me why, but some mysterious customer has asked me to produce a locator for GNK-series power droids. I threw together this schematic, and I've lined up a components supplier. Can you put together the last part I need and deliver it?",	"m46p":"Who needs a locator for gonk droids? Like you can't just see them lumbering around! Weird.",	"m46r":"Thanks. No, I'm not trying to locate power droids myself. I got this pickup assignment from an anonymous party over the HoloNet. All very hands-off. I'm going to get delivery instructions soon.",	"m46s":"Did you mention that the locator plugs into any standard datapad readout? Oh well, I'm sure whoever-it-is will figure it out. There are some weird customers out there.",	"m46t":"GNK Power Droid Locator",	"m47d":"I'm excited! A wealthy Moff in the Mid Rim is restoring a vintage Old Republic star yacht as his personal luxury craft. It needs a new custom reactant flow controller. I was up all last night designing it. Feverish! But I need one part custom-made. Can you pick up the components and build it?",	"m47p":"Here you go. Those Moffs always want high-quality work, so good luck. Take the completed part to our shipping agent.",	"m47r":"Does this go in the reactant flow controller? I haven't seen one of those in -- well, ever. Looks like a museum piece. I'll forward it to the Moff at once.",	"m47s":"Thanks! The Moff told me he might swing by this world in his new yacht and give me a joyride. I'm still flustered!",	"m47t":"Help Restore Moff's Luxury Yacht",	"m48d":"A certain anonymous pilot has crash-landed on this world and wants to make repairs without undue attention. This individual's customized Corellian Engineering YT-1300 stock freighter needs a new hyperdrive coolant regulator of unusual design. Here are the plans. Pick up the parts and build the indicated part for the regulator. Tell no one!",	"m48p":"Did you see any suspicious characters following you? Well, here are the materials. Work quickly. Tell no one!",	"m48r":"This will do. Were you followed? Excuse me, I must go.",	"m48s":"Thank you. If anyone mentions the name \"Tenloss Syndicate,\" you never heard of it. Remember, spies are everywhere.",	"m48t":"Anonymous Corellian Stock Freighter",	"m49d":"A government official is making a diplomatic visit to a world in Wild Space. Apparently the natives use some means of vocalization that his protocol droid can't duplicate. He needs a new custom-designed droid vocabulator. Here's the schematic for the last remaining piece. Can you pick up the materials and build it?",	"m49p":"I saw that design. Seems to vocalize in the high ultrasonic. Here are the components you need.",	"m49r":"I'll install this and deliver the vocabulator to the diplomat's droid. Hope it won't put up too much fuss over the installation. I guess we can just shut it down first.",	"m49s":"The official is also ordering special earphones that hear ultrasonic sounds. This will be some trip!",	"m49t":"Protocol Droid Vocabulator",	"m50d":"An official from this world is visiting Wild Space on a diplomatic mission. The natives he's meeting with vocalize in the high ultrasonic range. He needs a special transponder and earphone to hear them. Can you make an important piece for the transponder from this design? Pick up the materials from my supplier.",	"m50p":"This is the stuff you'll need. After you rig up the transponder, deliver it to the coordinates you've been given.",	"m50r":"Here, let me install your piece and try out this transponder -- wow! Who knew all this ultrasonic noise was going on all around us? Okay, thanks.",	"m50s":"That diplomat also has to get his protocol droid refitted. Quite a trip he's planning.",	"m50t":"Ultrasonic Speech Transponder",	"number_of_entries":"50"
