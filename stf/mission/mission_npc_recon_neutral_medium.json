		"m1o":"My son has been sneaking off late at night, and I have a suspicion he's up to no good. I've narrowed down the area where I think he visits. Could you check it out for me?",	"m1d":"Gangster",	"m1c":"I knew that good-for-nothing was up to some mischief! Well, I'll be a Sithspawn if he thinks I won't put a stop to this activity! No son of mine is going to be a swooper!",	"m1t":"A Timely Intervention",	"m2o":"Some of the local youth have been running errands for a \"businessman\" who recently moved here. I don't trust this individual and would like for you to check out this \"legitimate operation.\"",	"m2d":"Gangster",	"m2c":"Just as I suspected. Well I for one am going to make sure our community is not taken over by criminals. Thanks, citizen.",	"m2t":"A Legitimate Operation?",	"m3o":"My nephew has taken to wearing a black and red jacket and seems eager to own a swoop. I think his new friends are involved in criminal activity. Could you scout out their hangout and see what's going on?",	"m3d":"Gangster",	"m3c":"I thought gangsters had moved into the area. I certainly hope these aren't those Shadow Angels I've heard about. Those are some fearsome swoopers. ",	"m3t":"The Shadow of Angels",	"m4o":"I found some glitterstim canisters in my son's room. I think he's been getting this poison from a local gang. Could you check out these coordinates and see what those rogues are up to?",	"m4d":"Gangster",	"m4c":"They must be refining the spice. An operation that big could distribute spice to several cities. Thanks for the info, citizen.",	"m4t":"A Spice Refinery?",	"m5o":"Rumor has it that smugglers are trying to set up shop somewhere near here. I think I know where they've built their hideout, but I need you to verify it for me. I'll pay you for your time.",	"m5d":"Smuggler",	"m5c":"Aha! I knew it! Thanks, friend. Here's your pay. I can go to the local authorities with this information now.",	"m5t":"Find the Smugglers",	"m6o":"It seems trouble follows me around the galaxy. Every new neighborhood I come to seems to start attracting more criminals the minute I move in. Could you check these coordinates and let me know what's going on?",	"m6d":"Smuggler",	"m6c":"Figures. Well, I guess you just can't run away from your past. Maybe I'll move to Imperial Center next. Thanks for your help.",	"m6t":"Trouble Magnet",	"m7o":"Some friends of mine were thinking of starting up a mining operation. I haven't heard from them in a while and was wondering if you could check them out and see how they're faring.",	"m7d":"Smuggler",	"m7c":"Really? Hmm, that is interesting. Doesn't sound like a mining operation to me. Thanks, friend.",	"m7t":"Those Aren't Miners",	"m8o":"I've received several orders for supplies with instructions that they be delivered via droid courier only. One of these droids came back still bearing its destination coordinates. Could you see who I've been dealing with all this time?",	"m8d":"Smuggler",	"m8c":"Smugglers? I should have known. These deliveries were bringing in way more money than normal. Never trust anything too good to be true.",	"m8t":"Too Good To Be True",	"m9o":"I lost a brother to bloodthirsty pirates, and now I suspect they've established a base near here. Could you check out these coordinates and verify my suspicion?",	"m9d":"Pirate",	"m9c":"I'll get those lousy murderers if it's the last thing I do. Thanks, friend, you've helped me move closer to avenging my dear departed brother.",	"m9t":"You Killed My Brother",	"m10o":"There's a rumor that a group of pirates has gotten its hands on several Imperial TIE starfighters. News this bad has to be substantiated. Think you can help?",	"m10d":"Pirate",	"m10c":"Didn't see any TIE fighters, eh? I'd better report this to the authorities in any case and get those rogues off our planet.",	"m10t":"Stolen Starfighters",	"m11o":"A friend thinks a band of notorious pirates has established a base near here. He doesn't want to risk upsetting them, but I'm made of sterner stuff. Could you check it out for me? ",	"m11d":"Pirate",	"m11c":"There are pirates there? Oh! We should leave well enough alone, I guess. Thanks for your help. And for the record, we've never actually met.",	"m11t":"Here There Be Pirates",	"m12o":"Our neighborhood is quite safe without the Empire sending in additional stormtrooper patrols. They tend to be worse than the criminals, anyway. Could you find out where these patrols are coming from?",	"m12d":"Imperial",	"m12c":"A military outpost? Why do they deem that necessary? I'd better warn all my friends. Thanks, citizen.",	"m12t":"More Stormtroopers?",	"m13o":"I warned my contacts in COMPNOR about Rebel activity in this area. They claim it was being taken care of. Could you investigate these coordinates and see what is being done?",	"m13d":"Imperial",	"m13c":"They've set up an Imperial garrison? Now that's what I call results. I'll have to thank my COMPNOR friends.",	"m13t":"COMPNOR Gets Results",	"m14o":"There's been an increase of stormtrooper patrols in this region. I think the Empire is up to something. Could you check these coordinates out and see what's up? ",	"m14d":"Imperial",	"m14c":"The Empire's setting up a garrison this close to our city? What could they possibly be looking for? They didn't see you, right?",	"m14t":"That Pesky Empire",	"m15o":"Convoys in the middle of the night, strange folk hanging about at odd hours -- all this makes me think somebody is up to no good. Could you check it out for me?",	"m15d":"Rebel",	"m15c":"A Rebel outpost, eh? I think this information will be quite valuable. Thanks for your time. I've got some transmissions to send out.",	"m15t":"Some Valuable Information",	"m16o":"There's been some suspicious activity out in the wilderness. I need someone to check these coordinates out and report back to me. Think you can help me, citizen?",	"m16d":"Rebel",	"m16c":"An Alliance outpost? You're sure about this, citizen? Thank you for your time. Please keep this mission confidential.",	"m16t":"A Voice in the Wilderness",	"m17o":"I'm about to make a life-changing decision, but I need to make sure I'm not heading into a trap. Could you check these coordinates out for me and let me know what you find?",	"m17d":"Rebel",	"m17c":"I see. Say no more, friend. Thank you for your time. I now know what I must do.",	"m17t":"A Grim Decision",	"m18o":"My daughter ran away some time back, and I've only now located the coordinates of her last transmission. Can you report back to me on what's there now?",	"m18d":"Pirate",	"m18c":"During our last argument, my daughter threatened to run away and join a pirate gang. Sorry to say, it sounds like she followed through. Well, thank you, I guess.",	"m18t":"A Wayward Soul",	"m19o":"Local droid repair merchants are complaining that smuggled chromium plating is undermining their business. We're checking several possible drop points. Can you report on what you find at these coordinates?",	"m19d":"Smuggler",	"m19c":"You've found the smugglers! Excellent work. The merchants' association will take it from here, thanks.",	"m19t":"Help the Merchants",	"m20o":"The Hutt criminal syndicate is trying to corner the local market for Lowickan firegems. We want to compile a full report of their activities for local authorities. Can you check these coordinates and report back here?",	"m20d":"Gangster",	"m20c":"That's a more substantial Hutt presence than we suspected. This will definitely go in our report. Thank you!",	"m20t":"What the Hutt?",	"m21o":"I bought a solar panel on the black market, and it's already broken. I want to complain to the scum who sold me the panel. First I have to find them -- or pay you to do it. Will you check these coordinates?",	"m21d":"Gangster",	"m21c":"Very well. Now I'll bring in this broken panel and demand a refund. What could go wrong?",	"m21t":"Shoddy Goods",	"m22o":"To restrict local hyperdrive production, the Corporate Sector has bribed local Imperials to blockade durelium imports. Some locals have smuggled in durelium, but they've avoided contact since making landfall. I want you to check the prearranged coordinates and report back.",	"m22d":"Smuggler",	"m22c":"It sounds like all is going well so far. We'll rendezvous with the durelium suppliers shortly, and get around this ridiculous blockade. Thank you!",	"m22t":"Durelium Troubles",	"m23o":"To restrict local hyperdrive repair operations, the Corporate Sector has bribed local Imperials to blockade durelium imports. Some locals have smuggled in durelium, but they've avoided contact since making landfall. I want you to check the prearranged coordinates and report back.",	"m23d":"Imperial",	"m23c":"Uh-oh. Sounds like the durelium operation is quashed for now. Thank you for letting us know before we marched into an Imperial stronghold.",	"m23t":"Durelium Woes",	"m24o":"I've been looking for Spookcrystals from Nam Chorios. They help plants grow. I think I've found a source, but the supplier says he's been taken over by Imperials! Can you check on that and report back?",	"m24d":"Imperial",	"m24c":"Why would the Empire care about Spookcrystals? Maybe those rumors are true that they have other uses... Well, thanks anyway.",	"m24t":"Secure the Spookcrystals",	"m25o":"This city has seen several murders committed using dart shooters tipped with Devaronian blood-poison. That's only available off-world. I'm hiring you to check the coordinates I have for the poison's source on this world. Report back on who's bringing it in.",	"m25d":"Smuggler",	"m25c":"All right, thanks for your report. It's a nasty business, rounding up poisoners. Your efforts will help us stop these terrible killings.",	"m25t":"Find the Poisoner",	"m26o":"Mine-layer droids are a blight on modern warfare. We heard a rumor that the Empire is building a new mine-droid factory near here. Obviously we citizens don't want to complain publicly, but there are steps we can take -- if this factory is what rumor says. Can you check and report back?",	"m26d":"Smuggler",	"m26c":"Those sound like ordinary smugglers, not Imperials. I don't know whether to feel relieved. They may be bringing in something worse than mine-droids. Well, thanks anyway.",	"m26t":"Nasty Mine-Droids",	"m27o":"A local crime cartel is trying to take control of the city's gambling dens. An informant tells me the cartel's HQ is outside town at these coordinates. I'll pay you to recon the area and report back. Be careful!",	"m27d":"Gangster",	"m27c":"Excellent! Now Jabba the Hutt will know where to drop-ship a crate of thermal detonators. Thanks for helping Lord Jabba stop those upstarts.",	"m27t":"A New Cartel",	"m28o":"A local crime cartel is trying to take control of the city's gambling dens. An informant tells me the cartel's HQ is outside town at these coordinates. I'll pay you to recon the area and report back. Be careful!",	"m28d":"Gangster",	"m28c":"Those crooks are a growing menace to this society. I'm going to notify the authorities and have this cartel raided. Good work, citizen!",	"m28t":"Stop the Cartel",	"m29o":"Our merchant association believes smugglers are raiding inbound shipments of ardanium. We need that metal for our starship fuel canisters. I'm commissioning you to check out the smuggling base and report its defenses to me.",	"m29d":"Rebel",	"m29c":"Not smugglers? The Alliance? Hmm. I suppose the Alliance needs starship fuel canisters too. Hmm. Well, thank you anyway.",	"m29t":"Where's the Ardanium?",	"m30o":"Our merchant association believes smugglers are raiding inbound shipments of ardanium. We need that metal for our starship fuel canisters. I'm commissioning you to check out the smuggling base and report its defenses to me.",	"m30d":"Rebel",	"m30c":"Not smugglers? The Allliance? Those scoundrels! I'll alert the Imperial Security Bureau immediately. Thank you, citizen!",	"m30t":"Ardanium Is Precious",	"m31o":"A collector on this world -- I won't say where -- owns valuable aurodium ingots from Old Republic days. He's been getting threats that someone is planning a heist. He's relayed the coordinates to me, and I'd like you to check them out. Report back if you see anything suspicious.",	"m31d":"Pirate",	"m31c":"Pirates! The threats are true! I'll have to -- I mean, the collector will have to relocate his aurodium somewhere more secure. Leave me alone now, I have to think.",	"m31t":"Protect the Aurodium",	"m32o":"Black-marketers are now selling counterfeit military medals. It boils my blood to think of local cowards wearing a Kalidor Crescent. An informant told me the factory is at these coordinates. I want you to verify that and report back on its defenses, if any.",	"m32d":"Imperial",	"m32c":"The Empire, making counterfeit Alliance medals? But why? Oh, I see -- they must have hidden trackers. A clever way to locate sympathizers. Okay, thank you anyway.",	"m32t":"Find the Fake Medals",	"m33o":"Pirates are raiding rich ship cargoes almost as soon as they lift off. The pirates must have spies near this city, scouting cargo manifests. I've had reports of suspicious activity at these coordinates. I'll pay you to check out the location, but be careful.",	"m33d":"Pirate",	"m33c":"I see. The pirate outpost you found is just what I expected. I'll plan accordingly before my own cargo goes off-world. Thank you.",	"m33t":"Track the Pirate Spies",	"m34o":"I think local gangsters are impersonating Imperial troops to extort money from merchants. I've seen some of them heading toward these coordinates. If you can verify that they're not Imperials but common thieves, I'll get the Empire to wipe them out.",	"m34d":"Rebel",	"m34c":"Rebels? Do you think they're really Alliance, or just gangsters impersonating them? I don't know whether to call in the Empire now. Maybe I'll find someone else to do some more recon. Thank you, I think.",	"m34t":"Who's Who?",	"m35o":"I heard a rumor that the authorities are up to something. I don't suppose you'd be willing to go have a look? I'd go myself, but they might recognize me.",	"m35d":"Imperial",	"m35c":"Aha. Imperial authorities, no less. Very interesting. Thanks, I can use that information.",	"m35t":"Check Out the Authorities",	"m36o":"Is it true that the Alliance has an installation on this planet? I'd be willing to join their cause, if I can verify that it's really them. Can you check it out for me?",	"m36d":"Rebel",	"m36c":"I knew it! I'll pack my things and go there at once. At last I can do my part to bring down the Empire!",	"m36t":"Join the Cause",	"m37o":"A lifter load of my power converters was lost a fair distance from here. I'll pay you well if you have a look at those coordinates and find out what happened to my goods.",	"m37d":"Gangster",	"m37c":"These gangsters are starting to get on my nerves. I'll have to see what I can do about it. Thanks.",	"m37t":"Take a Stand",	"m38o":"I'm supposed to receive a shipment from off-world, but I'm not sure I trust the \"import agency\" that was contracted for the job. I'll pay you to check them out and let me know if they're dangerous.",	"m38d":"Pirate",	"m38c":"Sounds like they're a bunch of cutthroats! There's no way I'm going to do business with their kind. Thanks for the warning.",	"m38t":"A Little Investigative Work",	"m39o":"I'm supposed to receive a shipment from off-world, but I'm not sure I trust the \"import agency\" that was contracted for the job. I'll pay you to check them out and let me know if they're dangerous.",	"m39d":"Smuggler",	"m39c":"I thought they sounded like a lawless bunch. Possibly I can make some kind of arrangement with them. Thanks for the opportunity.",	"m39t":"Scope out the Agency",	"m40o":"Supposedly a friend of mine was spirited away by Imperial authorities. Are you brave enough to check out the facility and see if he's there? His family will be very appreciative.",	"m40d":"Imperial",	"m40c":"Doesn't sound like that's the kind of Imperial facility where they keep political prisoners. I'll have to keep searching for my poor, lost friend. I'm much obliged for your help.",	"m40t":"Help Locate a Friend",	"m41o":"I'm supposed to receive a shipment from off-world, but I'm not sure I trust the \"import agency\" that was contracted for the job. I'll pay you to check them out and let me know if they're dangerous.",	"m41d":"Rebel",	"m41c":"You really think they're from the Alliance? Why, I'm happy to do business with them. Down with the Empire! Thank you for the information.",	"m41t":"Who Are They?",	"m42o":"I've heard that the Black Sun organization has built a spice trading depot on this very planet. I want to hire you to check it out, citizen, if you think you're good enough not to get caught.",	"m42d":"Gangster",	"m42c":"That doesn't sound like a Black Sun operation, though it's certainly armed heavily enough to warrant notifying law enforcement. I appreciate your service, citizen.",	"m42t":"Black Sun?",	"m43o":"A cargo of 2-1B medical droids was recently stolen. I think I've found the pirates who took them. I need you to verify the location of their lair. Be wary, and tell no one of your mission!",	"m43d":"Pirate",	"m43c":"That sounds like the same pirates, all right. They've probably fenced the medical droids already. Don't worry; they're going to compensate me and then some.",	"m43t":"Find the Medical Droids",	"m44o":"I was fired from Imperial Customs for letting some notorious smugglers slip through my fingers. But I think I've finally tracked them down! If you can verify their location, I'll take my revenge.",	"m44d":"Smuggler",	"m44c":"I knew it! That's the smuggler gang I'm after. You have my gratitude, friend. I wish you had worked for me at Imperial Customs.",	"m44t":"Help Imperial Customs",	"m45o":"I think my brother's Imperial unit is stationed on-planet, but he won't confirm or deny it. I have the coordinates of his last transmission. Can you see if he's there?",	"m45d":"Imperial",	"m45c":"So my brother's Imperial unit is here. I wonder why he wouldn't tell me? Anyway, now I can get the money he owes me. Thanks.",	"m45t":"Where's My Brother?",	"m46o":"Somebody rubbed out my favorite goon, and I got to find out what sleemo did it! Can you check out the individuals at this location? I will be much appreciative and whatnot.",	"m46d":"Rebel",	"m46c":"Rebels, eh? Well, I don't care if they got warships and whatnot; they crossed the wrong guy's path this time. I'll put the squeeze on those sleemos.",	"m46t":"Find the Sleemos",	"m47o":"You there! I have obtained the coordinates of a gentleman who, with his companions, treated me unkindly. I require you to investigate whether these coordinates are authoritative. It would be unseemable of you to ignore this behest. Thank you.",	"m47d":"Gangster",	"m47c":"I say, that does indeed sound like the gentlemen who offended me. Now I shall extract an apology. I do appreciate your very exemplary service.",	"m47t":"A Matter of Honor",	"m48o":"I have a blind date with a certain individual who works at these coordinates. Can you check the place out for me, so I don't wind up dating the wrong sort? Thanks.",	"m48d":"Pirate",	"m48c":"Sounds like pirates to me. How exciting! That's just the sort of glamorous occupation I'd hoped my date would have! Thank you so much for your help.",	"m48t":"Scope Out a Date",	"m49o":"Three weeks late and my off-world cargo still hasn't arrived! Do you have time to check out this shipping agency for me? I'm willing to pay well just to find out where my cargo is.",	"m49d":"Smuggler",	"m49c":"Ahh, it's a smuggling operation, eh? That explains it. Imperial patrols are heavy this season in the local star lanes. Guess I'll just have to be patient.",	"m49t":"Late Cargo",	"m50o":"You give your heart to someone, and it turns out they're cheating on you! Please go to this location and find out what my sweetheart is doing there. I've got some credits for you when you return.",	"m50d":"Imperial",	"m50c":"What? My sweetheart is reporting to an Imperial base? Maybe it's a covert mission or an espionage ring or something romantic like that. Thank you so much!",	"m50t":"Spy on a Sweetheart",	"number_of_entries":"50"
