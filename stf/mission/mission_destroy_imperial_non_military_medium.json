This depot will probably be well guarded and will certainly be well defended (it is a weapons depot, after all). Can we rely on you to teach these Rebel scum a lesson and turn their depot into a miniature sun? The Empire would be most pleased.",	"m1f":"Those Rebels were too much for you, eh? I suppose an attack on a munitions depot would be the sort of mission only very skilled and loyal Imperial agents should ever attempt. Your failure is disappointing but perhaps not terribly surprising.",	"m1i":"Those damn probe droids. We hope there's an updated model on its way soon. We'll double-check those coordinates and find that munitions depot.

Your Imperial service record is shaping up quite nicely.",	"m1t":"Destroy Rebel munitions depot",	"m2d":"A Rebel mining facility has been identified by Intelligence and we need it destroyed. These Rebels have a habit of slipping through our blockades during a full military strike so we'd like you to lead a small team of loyal agents to accomplish this mission instead. Do you think you can serve your Empire in this manner?",	"m2f":"How could such an insignificant thing as a mining facility prove too much for you? We'd been led to believe you were an effective agent. It seems that information might have been inaccurate.",	"m2i":"Perhaps Intelligence had confused a legitimate Mining Guild facility for an illegal Rebel one. That has been know to happen in the past. We'll verify with them.",	"m2l":"",	"m2o":"Imperial Army",	"m2s":"If the Rebels thought we would overlook a small mining operation, they were sadly mistaken. Well done.

Put this place out of operation - in fact, burn it to the ground. We will not have this sort of Rebel activity in that sector. How dare the Rebels think this would go unnoticed. Can the Empire rely on you? ",	"m3f":"You failed? How much trouble could a few sensor dishes and some transceivers have given you?

It seems they have been using sick citizens as cover, trying to get us to believe they were operating according to Imperial laws. We feel for these sick individuals, although no doubt many of them are Rebel sympathizers, but this facility must be destroyed. We'd like to leave the details of such an operation to you, citizen. Do you think you're up to the task? Once you see Rebel soldiers defending this facility, you will find it much easier to sacrifice the patients inside.",	"m4f":"You couldn't even take out a facility filled with sick and wounded individuals? What sort of agent are you? Perhaps failure means nothing to you but it stains our reputation.",	"m4i":"How could the Rebels have moved so many sick people so fast?

You have done very well and we are highly pleased. Our missions require someone with a strong constitution. You should seek us out in the future.",	"m4t":"Destroy Rebel medical facility",	"m5d":"Rebels have been transporting alien refugees to various outposts throughout the galaxy. Many of these refugees are escaped slaves or criminals. We've managed to locate one of these outposts and now need to make sure it will no longer serve the cause of the Rebellion. We need a trusted agent to eradicate this facility and show the Rebels that the Empire will always find those who seek to escape Imperial justice. Are you that agent? We hope so.

Seek us out for future employment.",	"m5t":"Destroy Rebel alien refugee outpost",	"m6d":"Thanks to the efforts of our many loyal civilian informants, we've managed to verify the existence of a Rebel transport repair facility. We kept wondering where those Rebels would take their airspeeders, speeder bikes, and groundspeeders when they needed repairs. After all, many of them bear the evidence of skirmishes with local civil authorities or Imperial forces. Well now we know. We'd like this installation eliminated. We understand you are quite efficient at such work. Can the Empire count on you?",	"m6f":"Did they all just hop on their speeders and zoom away? How could you fail at such a mission. It's not like we were sending you against a command center. How disappointing.

Don't spend your reward all in one place.",	"m6t":"Destroy Rebel transport repair facility",	"m7d":"We've unearthed a Rebel indoctrination camp. Within the walls of these dreadful facilities, the minds of loyal citizens are poisoned and warped by the efforts of twisted medical droids and large quantities of illegal glitterstim drugs. It's a horrible sight to behold, citizen. We must terminate the activities of this vile installation and insure our citizens remain safe from such atrocities and loyal to the Empire. Can you help your Emperor stamp out this loathsome practice? The Empire needs you. ",	"m7f":"Now the Rebellion will have more brainwashed clones to add to their ranks. How can you sleep at night knowing you failed the Empire in this one vital way? We are incredibly displeased.",	"m7i":"Are you sure you didn't go into that camp and simply don't remember the experience, citizen? Maybe you should have one of our medical droids look you over? This is most suspicious.",	"m7l":"",	"m7o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m7s":"Hurrah! You have doubtless saved hundreds of loyal citizens from a terrible fate, citizen.

You are a true champion of the Empire.",	"m7t":"Destroy Rebel indoctrination camp",	"m8d":"We've discovered a Rebel terrorist sleeper cell masquerading as a droid maintenance facility. We suspect that this cell has been responsible for the deaths of no less than 100 Imperial servants and the destruction of millions of credits worth of property. I think you'll agree that the proper thing for a loyal citizen of the Empire to do is to reward one ill turn with another and burn this installation to the ground. Are you the agent we're looking for? These terrorists must pay for their terrible acts of violence against the Empire.",	"m8f":"How heavily guarded could this installation have been? We do not understand the reason for your failure, citizen. Perhaps you were not the agent we were thinking of when we assigned this mission.",	"m8i":"Can a droid maintenance facility disappear overnight? This is most irregular. We must investigate this matter. Report back later and I'm sure we'll have this straightened out.",	"m8l":"",	"m8o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m8s":"The deaths of all those Imperial servants are now avenged!

Claim your just reward.",	"m8t":"Destroy Rebel terrorist cell",	"m9d":"A Rebel supply depot has been located. The front for it seems to be a scientific observation outpost of some sort. However, our surveillance images clearly show known Rebels patrolling the facility's perimeter. We need a trusted agent to lead a strike against this installation and insure its destruction. There's no telling how many cells this depot has been supplying or how many Imperial lives have been lost as a result. Can we count on you to undertake this dangerous mission? It will not be easy but the rewards will be worth it if you succeed.",	"m9f":"They probably managed to get most of their supplies out since you failed to destroy the facility. There's no telling what sorts of equipment was in there. Perhaps even prototype starfighters or weapons. This is most disappointing. Losing your reward should be the least of your worries currently, citizen.",	"m9i":"This information came from Imperial Intelligence, which can have the habit of being occasionally spotty. We'll inform them that they need to take better care when sending out intelligence reports such as this.",	"m9l":"",	"m9o":"Imperial Security Bureau",	"m9s":"Whatever was in that warehouse will not serve those Rebels now.

Collect your reward with pride - you've earned it.",	"m9t":"Destroy Rebel supply depot",	"m10d":"Instead of being horrified, as all loyal citizens should have been, by the Rebellion's destruction of the Empire's most brilliant and effective weapon against injustice, it seems instead that this terrorist act has encouraged some malcontents to form their own Rebel cell. And they've done it in such a flagrant and obvious manner that we didn't have to look too hard to find it. We need a true model citizen of the Empire to show these troublemakers the consequences of throwing their lot in with these traitors and terrorists. Are you that citizen? Can we rely on you to burn this newly formed Rebel cell to cinders? We will not rest easy until these criminals are atomized.",	"m10f":"You must understand that this failure will only encourage more of these undesirables to form these terrorist cells. How can you live with that fact? Your failure will cost many innocent Imperial citizens their lives. Frankly, we're disgusted.",	"m10i":"They must have heard that we were taking matters into our own hands and have fled the scene.

You can never be too sure.",	"m10t":"Destroy new Rebel cell",	"m11d":"One of Sienar Fleet System's chief engineers has foolishly decided to join the ranks of those traitorous Rebels. The Rebellion was eager to get this individual to safety as they had helped design some new TIE starfighters for the Empire. We've located this engineer and need them silenced before they can supply the Rebellion with technical specs. We believe the traitor is being held at a small warehouse currently used to store speeder parts. We require a skilled and loyal agent to strike this warehouse and blast it to atoms, taking everything inside with it. The facility will no doubt be guarded. Can the Empire rely on you to accomplish this mission?",	"m11f":"The survival of this engineer could be disastrous to the Empire. Your failure puts us all at risk.

We promise you that.",	"m11l":"",	"m11o":"Imperial Intelligence",	"m11s":"Well done, agent.

You must work for us again in the future.",	"m11t":"Take out traitorous engineer",	"m12d":"The Empire has located a small station that is being used by the Rebels to entice young pilots to join their traitorous cause. Apparently these Rebels have several X-wing flight simulators that they allow local pilots to play around with. Unfortunately, this is often enough to get some of these naïve flyboys to sign up. The Imperial Navy understands the lure of a well designed starfighter. We need this station destroyed and everything inside incinerated. Can the Empire count on you, citizen?",	"m12f":"More Rebel pilots mean more attacks on Imperial shipyards and garrisons. The Empire cannot afford that, citizen. Your failure will cost us dearly.",	"m12i":"The coordinates were not correct, eh? We'll have to investigate this matter further. Check back with us soon.",	"m12l":"",	"m12o":"Imperial Navy",	"m12s":"Little did those local flyboys realize that playing with a flight simulator could be very dangerous indeed. Well done, citizen. The Empire is pleased to reward one such as you.",	"m12t":"Destroy Rebel training station",	"m13d":"Intelligence has finally located one of the Rebellion's data slicer hubs.

We've acquired the coordinates of this facility and need a small team of loyal Imperial agents to obliterate it. The only other option facing convicted Rebels, besides a lifetime of back-breaking labor in service to the Empire, is death. Can you see to it that this is carried out? The Empire is counting on you.",	"m14f":"Allowing convicted criminals to escape is not good, citizen. The Empire is terribly disappointed by your lack of success.",	"m14i":"One of the Viceprexes working for the Rebellion must have tipped them off. We'll find which of them is serving those traitorous scum.",	"m14l":"",	"m14o":"Imperial Army",	"m14s":"Well done! We couldn't have done it any better ourselves. The Empire could use more agents like you.",	"m14t":"Destroy Rebel refugee facility",	"m15d":"A shipment of Merr-Sonn IR-5 blaster pistols has fallen into the hands of the Rebellion and we believe we've learned where these deadly weapons are being stored. They will certainly be distributed to various Rebel cells for use in intimidation missions. We must destroy this cache of weapons before those scum can use them against our agents. Can the Empire count on you to undertake this mission?",	"m15f":"Those blasters will no doubt claim many Imperial agents' lives. Your failure is most alarming to us. Perhaps you're not cut out for this sort of work.",	"m15i":"They must have moved the weapons already. Damn! We'll have to work hard to track them down.",	"m15l":"",	"m15o":"Imperial Intelligence",	"m15s":"Those deadly \"Intimidators\" won't threaten the safety of our agents. Good work! The Empire gladly rewards success and loyalty.",	"m15t":"Destroy Rebel weapons cache",	"m16d":"Several MD medical droids have been acquired by the Rebellion. Our spies have provided us with the coordinates to the holding facility where these droids are being stored. We cannot allow the Rebels to have access to proper medical care.

Do you think you could assist the Empire in this endeavor?",	"m16f":"Medical droids may not seem that important to you, but it is an immense boon to the Rebellion. Your failure alarms us.

A loyal Imperial strike team is needed to take these droidekas out of commission. Do you think this is a mission you could handle?

We've located a supply depot filled with mining equipment, including large quantities of explosives and Demolitionmech droids.
