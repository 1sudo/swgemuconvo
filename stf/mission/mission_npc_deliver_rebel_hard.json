The captain of the Star Destroyer Beleaguer is hosting an officer's party on his flight deck. We've hidden a listening device in the ommni-box that the band will be using. If we're lucky we might catch some random intelligence. I want you to fetch the bugged instrument from our offworld agent and bring it back to me. Got it?",	"m39p":"Here's the ommni-box. It's a little off-key in the fourth septave of the Bith echo minor scale, but the Imperials shouldn't notice. I think.",	"m39c":"Ahh, good. I hope the musicians won't notice the switch. One ommni-box is just like another, I always say.",	"m39i":"Bugged Ommni-Box",	"m39t":"Deliver an Ommni-Box",	"m39f":"instrument\ommni_box.iff",	"m40o":"At last we have evidence to prove Imperial atrocities on Tyshapahl. I want you to pick up the package from our transport pilot and bring it back to me. I understand this evidence is volatile, so waste no time in getting it here. Thank you.",	"m40p":"Yeah, so, here it is. Yes, it's a corpse. Yes, it's not frozen. They thawed it for an autopsy and never re-froze it. Some genius at High Command didn't want to risk destroying the evidence. So, now I pass this fragrant burden off to you. Enjoy.",	"m40c":"By the belt of Antilles! Who gave the command to leave this thing rotting like this? It's sickening! Quick, let me get this refrigerated before I smell as bad as a nerf-herder.",	"m40i":"Victim of Imperial Atrocity",	"m40t":"Transport Evidence of Imperial Crimes",	"m40f":"poi\corellia\poi_victim_sandpanther.iff",	"m41o":"This is great. We actually reprogrammed an Imperial mission terminal. Now we can send New Order activists into traps and away from our sensitive operations. Go pick up the terminal and bring it here so I can deploy it as soon as possible. I can't wait to watch these Imperials lapdogs chase after phantoms!",	"m41p":"Are you the one taking possession of the reprogrammed terminal? Excellent. Here it is, then. May the Force be with you.",	"m41c":"Terrific! This reprogrammed mission terminal is going to confuse the heck out of the Imperials. I've already got an idea to send them on missions to hunt down a prototype war droid based on the MSE-6 model. They're just dumb enough to fall for that, don't you think?",	"m41i":"Reprogrammed Imperial Mission Terminal",	"m41t":"Retrieve a Reprogrammed Mission Terminal",	"m41f":"mission\mission_terminal.iff",	"m42o":"A scientist loyal to the Alliance has developed some kind of new wilderness camouflage system. We've smuggled it to the planet. I need you to fetch it for me. If this device works, it could prove an immense help in the war against the Empire.",	"m42p":"Believe it or not, this is the fabled new camouflage system. A straw hut. Sometimes I wish we had the resources of the Empire. I really do.",	"m42c":"So. Um. This is the new camouflage system, eh? A hut. Well, you can't say we leave any option untested in the fight against the Empire.",	"m42i":"Big Straw Hut",	"m42t":"Fetch a Prototype Camouflage System",	"m42f":"poi\endor\poi_ewok_hut.iff",	"m43o":"A Zabrak spy has stolen the clothes of a high-ranking Imperial overseer. They will provide an excellent disguise for one of our agents. The spy was killed shortly afterward, but she managed to pass off the clothes to one of our civilian contacts. An Alliance pilot has flown them here. The Empire is on the lookout, so I need you to sneak to the rendezvous point, collect the package and make sure it gets back to me. Are you up to the job, my friend?",	"m43p":"Here are the clothes. They once belonged to an Imperial Inquisitor. I don't have to explain to you how rare they are, right?",	"m43c":"An Inquisitor's robe? Impressive! I've never seen one before. I'm not sure if we would ever disguise an agent as an Inquisitor, but you never know.

I need you to bring the shipment to me so I can pass it along to the next starship in our underground delivery system. Make sure no Imperials catch you!",	"m44p":"Here's the avabush spice. Did you know it can be used as a truth serum? I wonder what our secret backer is going to use it for? Hmm.",	"m44c":"Thank you. This avabush spice will help us continue the good work of the Alliance.

There's a small package I need you to deliver to me. It contains an Imperial Medal of Honor engraved with the name of Governor Tarkin. Contraband scavengers discovered it in the debris field around Yavin. This medal will make a splendid gift for someone in High Command. Can you bring it to me?",	"m45p":"It's kind of perverse, don't you think, handling an old war medal like some kind of sick trophy? I dunno. I mean Tarkin is dead. Let's move on, right?",	"m45c":"Ahh! Excellent. I can't wait to give Tarkin's old medal as a gift to someone in Alliance High Command. My star is rising, my friend, I assure you of that.

If you've got time, I need to have some of the stuff brought to me from a courier.",	"m46p":"You'd think they would transport explosive gel in some kind of container, wouldn't you? But no, here it is in a nice, handy blob. Careful, it sort of oozes through your fingers when it gets warm. I'd stay away from radio transmitters with this stuff, if I were you. Good luck.",	"m46c":"Thanks for the help.

These are the remains of a notorious Imperial torturer, left behind by a strike team I commissioned to destroy that base. See, you can tell by the stim implants in the ash.

Luck to you.",	"m49c":"I can't believe this is the very droid the Empire has been scouring the galaxy trying to find! I'm humbled.
