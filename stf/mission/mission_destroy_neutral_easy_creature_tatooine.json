My daughter's happiness depends on it.",	"m34o":"",	"m34s":"Thank you for helping me prepare for my daughter's wedding. I plan to take her out to the site in a few days. I know she's going to be overjoyed with the scenic view. I've paid a fortune for a wagon full of chuba pies and imported Corellian ale, but there's a little left over for you. My daughter's smile is worth every credit.",	"m34t":"Wedding Planner",	"m35d":"I'm young, but I'm not stupid. I know that it's going to be tough to leave Tatooine. I dream of someday joining the Academy, but just dreaming about something doesn't make it happen. So I spend every afternoon practicing my piloting skills in a beat-up skyhopper. I need alll those hours in the cockpit just to hone my skills. If I miss even a day, I lose my edge. But lately, my father has been asking me to spend more and more time out in the desert, patrolling the edge of our property looking for vermin that might bust up our moisture vaporators. Or I waste my afternoons repairing the stupid machines after the animals have bent the chilling panels trying to steal our water. So, here's my plan: I've saved a few credits and I'm willing to pay you to do my work for me. While you're destroying the nearest lair, I'll be racing through Beggar's Canyon. Someday, all this practice will pay off and I'll be one of the Empire's finest pilots.   ",	"m35o":"",	"m35s":"Thanks for helping me out. Since you agreed to help out, I've been able to spend even more time practicing in my skyhopper. The investment has been well worth it. In fact, I just snuck over to Bestine and applied to the Academy again. I took a flight test and, if I don't say so myself, I flew rings around the training drones. I think this time I finally caught the eye of the Imperial recruiter. I have a feeling I'm going to be spending the rest of my life shooting down enemies of the Empire!",	"m35t":"Farmboy Dreams",	"number_of_entries":"35"
