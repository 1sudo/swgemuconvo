		"m1d":"Imperial Intelligence has identified the leader of a vast logistics network that serves the Rebellion. The Ubiqtorate hereby decrees an Imperial death bounty on this individual. Only elite hunters should attempt to bring down this mark. The target will be very well armed and should be approached with maximum caution. Success will earn a commendation in the hunter's official dossier.",	"m1o":"Imperial Ubiqtorate",	"m1s":"This Rebel leader was a major thorn in the Emperor's side. You have earned the bounty and the respect of the Ubiqtorate. You will hear from us again.",	"m1t":"Highly Appointed Rebellion Facilitator",	"m1v":"You're going to regret finding me, bounty hunter!",	"m2d":"When the planetary government of Pliad 4 resisted Imperial annexation, a troublesome council of ministers was exiled to a prison world. These ministers have escaped custody. The Ubiqtorate hereby decrees an Imperial death bounty on each of these individuals. Hunters are warned that these ministers have demonstrated proficiency in armed combat, disguise, and clandestine movement. One bounty will be disbursed for each confirmed kill.",	"m2o":"Imperial Ubiqtorate",	"m2s":"Outstanding. At this rate we shall eliminate all these exiled ministers within the year. Claim your bounty.",	"m2t":"Exiled Planetary Minister",	"m2v":"Death to the Emperor and the New Order!",	"m3d":"A Rebel agent from Chryya, renowned for expertise with biotoxins, has poisoned a shipment of grain to Imperial troops under my command. I am offering a substantial bounty to the expert hunter who neutralizes this Rebel poisoner. Imperial law enforcement will forgive violent infractions committed during pursuit. Approach this task with utmost urgency. The Rebellion has a history of vanishing its agents after a major operation.",	"m3o":"Moff Krewe of Droma Sector",	"m3s":"Brilliantly handled bounty hunter. I foresee a long working relationship.",	"m3t":"Rebel Poisoner",	"m3v":"Sithspit! How did you find me this far from Droma Sector?",	"m4d":"A Rebel spy has infiltrated my command staff. Of course I detected the spy, but I must resolve the matter discreetly. I have granted the traitor a short leave of absence. The spy travels incognito, so expect a civilian and not a uniformed officer. Licensed hunters have my personal assurance that Imperial law enforcement will forgive any violent infractions committed during the elimination of this problem.",	"m4o":"Moff Krewe of Droma Sector",	"m4s":"Brilliantly done. Say nothing if Imperial Intelligence questions you. My superiors need not learn that my command staff was compromised.",	"m4t":"Rebel Spy in My Command Staff",	"m4v":"Who put a price on my head? Tell me!",	"m5d":"Lord Vader has requested my aid in removing troublesome Black Sun operatives. A certain Zekka Thyne from Corellia has hired assassins to wipe out his competition. Before we act directly against Thyne himself, I am issuing an Imperial bounty on Thyne's hired killers. These agents are masters of disguise and extremely lethal. Whoever succeeds in removing these individuals will earn the favor of Lord Vader and myself.",	"m5o":"Vice Admiral Thrawn",	"m5s":"Well done, bounty hunter. I reward those who serve me well. I may have work for you in the future.",	"m5t":"Black Sun Assassins",	"m5v":"What Vigo hired you, bounty hunter? I want to deliver your head to the fool when this is done!",	"m6d":"An expert on satellite power systems has vanished from an Imperial military project. Restricted information may be compromised if this engineer contacts the Rebellion. A substantial reward will be paid to the hunter who destroys this threat to the Emperor's plans. Make certain no one learns what that engineer knows. Disintegration is preferred. I want no mistakes.",	"m6o":"Lord Vader",	"m6s":"The Empire will compensate you for your effort. Speak to no one about this, bounty hunter. Do not make me explain the importance of secrecy.",	"m6t":"Reactor Core Engineer",	"m6v":"You won't take me back to Vader! I'll die first!",	"m7d":"My Star Destroyer was hosting a birthday celebration for the twin daughters of a local Moff. We hired an entertainer for the children. Our performer disabled the guards' blaster rifles while engaging them in an audience-participation routine. Then this putative entertainer trapped us at blaster-point, robbed the children of their gifts -- mostly jewels confiscated from political prisoners -- and made a clean escape. I will fund a bounty from my official budget to have this criminal blasted to atoms.",	"m7o":"Captain Nob Finial",	"m7s":"Good. My superiors are most interested in this case. They keep scheduling debriefings about the crime for an ever-expanding team of investigators. With luck, your success will speed my promotion to admiral.",	"m7t":"Audacious Robber",	"m7v":"Bring it on, bounty hunter! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around!",	"m8d":"A high-ranking officer in the Imperial Navy lost a battle to a squadron of Rebel star pilots. This officer failed to report to me for disciplinary action. I want this fugitive found. It is likely the officer will travel in disguise, but I do not expect you to be fooled. I want results as soon as possible. If I receive confirmation of a kill, I will double the posted bounty.",	"m8o":"Lord Vader",	"m8s":"You're as skilled as your reputation suggests bounty hunter. However, I will not be doubling the reward. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.",	"m8t":"Ex-Imperial Officer",	"m8v":"Vader is a madman!

Tell no one. Expect further assignments.\"",	"m12t":"Imperial Museum Theft Getaway Driver",	"m12v":"Think so?

Expect further assignments.\"",	"m13t":"Imperial Museum Theft Escape Pilot",	"m13v":"That's a mercy I can live without, thanks. You feel like tackling the Sith elite warbot we stole?
