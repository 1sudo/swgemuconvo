		"m1d":"How many times do we have to exterminate these pests? Hiring professional hunters is getting expensive. Could you go in and clear out that creature lair for us, citizen?",	"m1o":"",	"m1s":"Looks like you might have a career in extermination, friend. Thanks for your efforts.",	"m1t":"Clear Out Tenacious Pests",	"m2d":"I'm lodging a group of Bith musicians in my villa, but they're skittish about some of the local wildlife. I'd be willing to pay if you could remove some of the more dangerous creatures from the area and put these Bith at ease.",	"m2o":"",	"m2s":"Splendid! Now my Bith guests can relax and practice their music. I do enjoy their fizz lilting through my villa on a lazy evening.",	"m2t":"Reassure Skittish Musicians",	"m3d":"Some darn predator ate my good luck kima! I think those beasts have a lair near here. If you can find them and blast them to atoms, I'd certainly reward you.",	"m3o":"",	"m3s":"Thanks, friend. I'll sure miss that kima. I bet this breaks my incredible sabacc winning streak. ",	"m3t":"Recover Good Luck Charm",	"m4d":"My precious little kittle -- she liked to be called Woopywoopums -- was snatched by a horrible predator while slithering playfully in my yard. Please avenge my angel for me.",	"m4o":"",	"m4s":"You are most gallant, citizen. What is your name again? I want to name my new kittle in your honor.",	"m4t":"Avenge Woopywoopums",	"m5d":"I've been contracted to do some construction near here. Help me out by cleaning up the nest at these coordinates, and I'll cut you in.",	"m5o":"",	"m5s":"Nice work. I've never seen the need for a professional exterminator before. Those guys get the big money.",	"m5t":"Help Clear Land",	"m6d":"A condemned shelter near here is nothing but a breeding ground for bloodsucking parasites. I bet a couple of well-placed blaster shots would take care of the problem. Can you help, friend?",	"m6o":"",	"m6s":"Well done, citizen. This ought to make the wet season much more pleasant. Enjoy your reward!",	"m6t":"Prepare For Wet Season",	"m7d":"There's a den of vermin out there that is gonna kill some youngster some day. Local kids love playing in that area. Be a friend and demolish that lair for us, would you?",	"m7o":"",	"m7s":"I'll be able to sleep peacefully at night now. Thank you kindly.",	"m7t":"Keep Kids Safe",	"m8d":"The last thing I want to hear when I settle down to bed are the mating calls of blasted vermin! Please silence those love-sick beasts and help me get some peace and quiet.",	"m8o":"",	"m8s":"My gratitude knows no bounds, citizen. Well, actually it does, as your deposited payment will prove. But I'm still quite pleased.",	"m8t":"Wipe Out Lovesick Beasts",	"m9d":"My poor little durni, it wandered away and got lost. The tiny helpless thing can't see, you know. A friend saw a wild predator pounce on my darling and devour him. Oh horror! Please avenge my poor little Blinky.",	"m9o":"",	"m9s":"This sets my mind at ease, citizen. Many thanks. I hope I can mourn Blinky and move on.",	"m9t":"Avenge Little Blinky",	"m10d":"I just knew it was a bad idea to come to this planet! There's some kind of filthy creature lurking on the path to my new home. I don't suppose you'd be able to kill it for me, would you?",	"m10o":"",	"m10s":"Thank you ever so much! I suppose every planet will seem dangerous after leaving my poor, beautiful Alderaan.",	"m10t":"Make Planet Safer",	"m11d":"I'm looking to run some power conduits across an area not far from here, but there's a couple of pesky animals getting in the way of my spooling droids. Do you suppose you might take that weapon of yours and exterminate these pests?",	"m11o":"",	"m11s":"Thanks, buddy. You earned the credits. It's getting so you can't earn a decent living without a blaster these days.",	"m11t":"Get Rid of Pesky Animals",	"m12d":"I was testing my new electrobinoculars when I spotted a few toothy-looking beasts roaming around my land. If you want to earn a few credits, why don't you haul your weapon out there and take out those nasty creatures?",	"m12o":"",	"m12s":"You don't seem to be bad with that weapon. The credits I promised will be promptly deposited.",	"m12t":"Toothy Beasts Are Bad",	"m13d":"I've been tracking some genetically altered predators that were stolen from an Imperial research facility. Some apparently ended up here. If I could get your help in disposing of them, I'd make it worth your while.",	"m13o":"",	"m13s":"Hmm, those don't sound like the beasts I was tracking, but thanks for getting rid of dangerous predators anyway. A little something has been deposited in your account for your trouble.",	"m13t":"Genetically Altered Beasts Are Scary",	"m14d":"My goal of breeding exotic pets didn't go as planned. I've heard some of my \"failed experiments\" are now terrorizing the locals. Think you could take care of this problem for me?",	"m14o":"",	"m14s":"Thanks. Your pay has been deposited. I'd sure appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anyone, okay?",	"m14t":"Clean Up Failed Experiments",	"m15d":"My friends and I want to hold some speeder races outside of town, but there's some sort of creature lair out there that's holding us up. If you wipe it out, I'll pay you for your time.",	"m15o":"",	"m15s":"Thanks! You're a pal! I deposited your pay. Don't forget to come back in a few months and check the races out.",	"m15t":"Speeder Races Are Fun",	"m16d":"I lost something of great sentimental value in the wilderness and I'm determined to get it back. I've isolated the area where I think this treasure may lie, but there's a den of predators keeping me from performing a thorough search. Think you can get rid of it for me?",	"m16o":"",	"m16s":"Thanks, friend. I've compensated you for your trouble. Uh, you didn't happen to dig around, did you? Didn't find any precious stones?",	"m16t":"Recover Family Heirloom",	"m17d":"Some kids have disappeared in this area over the last few weeks. Some folk think it's the work of wild predators. I'll pay you to check these coordinates out and drive away any monsters you encounter.",	"m17o":"",	"m17s":"Good work, citizen. The children will compose a song in your honor. Oh, and I've deposited the pay I promised.",	"m17t":"Children Possibly Eaten",	"m18d":"My dying grandfather has one last wish -- to eat the flesh of the creatures that killed his beloved wife. I've tracked down a lair of the beasts and need you to kill some for me. Think you could do that?",	"m18o":"",	"m18s":"Excellent! I'll send my droids out to collect the carcasses. Don't worry if you didn't leave much meat -- my grandfather has hardly any teeth left.",	"m18t":"A Last Supper",	"m19d":"I perform tests of the groundwater, but my meters seem to attract all manner of vermin. It's the vibrations, I think. Could you please make sure there aren't any bothersome beasts hanging around my workstations?",	"m19o":"",	"m19s":"Thank you. It's always nice to know I can go to work in relative safety. I've deposited something for you in your account.",	"m19t":"Assist Public Servant",	"m20d":"My mother is sick and loves a certain flower that grows near here. I'd pick some for her, but there's some sort of creature lair near there, and I'm afraid those beasts might hurt me. Could you chase them away for me?",	"m20o":"",	"m20s":"Thank you so much. I'm sure the flowers will help my mother get better. Enjoy the reward for your services.",	"m20t":"Help Sick Mother",	"m21d":"My little daughter's beloved bearded jax was killed by some sort of wild beast recently. The darling just won't be consoled until those horrible pests are disposed of. Do you think you could do this for me?",	"m21o":"",	"m21s":"Thanks, friend. I hope what I deposited covers your inconvenience. I'm sure you understand just how important it is to keep our little angels happy.",	"m21t":"Console Little Angel",	"m22d":"Ever since my HyperGym broke down, I've taken to jogging outside the city. But the presence of wild beasts has recently rendered my favorite route useless. Could you get rid of these pests for me?",	"m22o":"",	"m22s":"Thanks, friend. I gave you something to cover the expenses you incurred while blasting those creatures. Now I'll be able to stay in shape.",	"m22t":"A Strike For Fitness",	"m23d":"The Imperial Zoological Agency claimed to have cleared these areas of dangerous beasts. I beg to differ. We've had a few attacks on children in the last couple of days. Could you get rid of whatever is threatening our kids?",	"m23o":"",	"m23s":"A thousand thanks, citizen. Perhaps you should seek a job with the Imperial Zoological Agency. Seems like you could show them how these things should be done.",	"m23t":"Clean Up Empire's Mess",	"m24d":"I've heard a lot of complaints about a crazy old wizard in the wilds who surrounds himself with ravenous beasts. I sent a range droid to find out where the old man lives. Now I want you to exterminate his animals. I can pay you, don't worry about that.",	"m24o":"",	"m24s":"Well done. Those animals won't bother anyone now. The old wizard probably ran away when he saw you coming. I hope that teaches him a lesson.",	"m24t":"A Crazy Wizard's Menagerie",	"m25d":"Something's been killing the young from my herd of gualamas. Now I have to keep my livestock indoors. I need a hunter to take care of this predator before I lose any more profits. If you can do the job, I'd love to hire you today.",	"m25o":"",	"m25s":"I'm glad nothing will be feeding on my gualamas. Thanks to you, that is.",	"m25t":"Save Gualama Herd",	"m26d":"They looked so cute when they were little, but my pets grew too big to keep. Now they've been feral for a year. The planetary authorities have warned me that they've become dangerous. I've got to get rid of them somehow. Would you be able to find my old pets and blast them into pieces?",	"m26o":"",	"m26s":"I still miss those poor little devils. Perhaps now they're in a better place. Thank you for the help.",	"m26t":"Good Pets Gone Bad",	"m27d":"I'm not obsessed with hokey religions, but I think some land I just bought is strong with the dark side of the Force. At least it's infested with some very unpleasant animals. You look tough enough to remove them from my property. Care to earn a few credits today?",	"m27o":"",	"m27s":"You have much skill and courage. The Force must be strong with you. Enjoy your reward.",	"m27t":"Face the Dark Side",	"m28d":"Cloning tests are fun, but I made the mistake of turning loose several test subjects. Not that these cloned animals can't defend themselves in the wild. Quite the opposite -- they have mauled several travellers through the area. How would like to help me clean up this mess by blasting these animals into atoms?",	"m28o":"",	"m28s":"Thanks. Of course, the thing about clones is that it's hard to stop making them after just ten or twenty. I may need your services again. Soon.",	"m28t":"Stop the Clones",	"m29d":"Remember the Techno Union? Of course you do. I think there might be an old outpost of theirs not far from here. I want to investigate further, but the area is home to some distinctly hostile creatures. I'd love to hire you to remove them. Then I can get on with my search for the outpost.",	"m29o":"",	"m29s":"Capital job! Now I can keep searching for that old Techno Union outpost. Who knows what they might have left behind?",	"m29t":"Techno Union Treasure",	"m30d":"I've found an excellent spot to set up an electro-telescope. I like to watch the big ships docking in orbit. But the last time I set up my rig, I was chased off by a couple of ugly, unpleasant creatures. I'll pay good money if you could get rid of those beasts for me.",	"m30o":"",	"m30s":"You've done me a great favor. Your payment has been deposited. Now I can monitor the activities of Imperial warships to report to the Alli-- um, I mean, I can watch the big ships docking in orbit.",	"m30t":"Help Amateur Astronomer",	"m31d":"I imported some ghhhks from Clak'dor VII. I heard their skin makes a healing salve. Well, it didn't do anything for me, and then the ghhhks got loose. Now they're breeding, and the scent has attracted a pack of hungry predators. I'd like you to destroy the predators before anything really bad happens.",	"m31o":"",	"m31s":"Thanks. I was afraid my neighbors were about to sue me for biological infestation. I hope the predators ate all the ghhhks before you killed them.",	"m31t":"Contain Biological Infestation",	"m32d":"I've commissioned a holosculptor to model several local beasts for a new dejarik board I'll be selling. She needs specimens, so I've located some at these coordinates. Please dispatch everything in this lair, but try to leave the bodies intact.",	"m32o":"",	"m32s":"Never mind. The holosculptor found adequate models on the HoloNet. Thanks anyway for your work, and I have deposited your fee.",	"m32t":"Improve the Game of Dejarik",	"m33d":"Some offworld things escaped from the recent Livestock Exhibition, and they've been terrorizing the countryside ever since. We've collected some money and found the likeliest spot where they lair. Can you go in and take out the whole pack, quickly?",	"m33o":"",	"m33s":"Did the creatures seem like offworld beasts to you? They may still be on the loose. Well, you did the job we asked for, so your money's been deposited.",	"m33t":"Hunt Offworld Beasts",	"m34d":"You smell that? That stinking dust on the wind? It's egg seeds, spewed by the shadow barnacles that infest the buildings around here. The egg seeds in turn attract beasts from hither and yon. There's a new lair nearby. Please go and destroy it, okay?",	"m34o":"",	"m34s":"That was some stink, eh? I'd better find a fungicide or something. Everything go okay? Your money should be in your account. ",	"m34t":"Stop Stinky Beasts",	"m35d":"I'm convinced I know the origin of the vicious pack animals now attacking children in this neighborhood. Some local Imperial bigwig imported them for his stupid menagerie, and they got loose! The police won't stop the beasts yet, because someone high up likes to make the Empire look bad. Can you destroy this menace?",	"m35o":"",	"m35s":"What a relief! All the parents in this neighborhood thank you. You've done us a great service and earned this reward.",	"m35t":"Stomp Rogue Zoo Animals",	"number_of_entries":"35"
