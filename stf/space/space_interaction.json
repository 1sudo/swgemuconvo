Without heroic intervention by citizen pilots such as you, this horrid 'rebellion' could prove to be the final undoing of our civilization, our liberty... our very lives. Hired killers have taken aim against  the selfless agents of our government, and have threatened to plunge us head-long into anarchy.    Moreover, sensing their despicable opportunities in this 'rebellion,' vast armies of corrupt criminal pirates, smugglers, and assassins have banded together to further tear the fabric of Imperial decency.    Your Emperor needs you. Your courage. Your skill.     Several of our most capable pilot recruiters have been dispatched to educate and inform all citizens of the galaxy who have the mettle to fly for the Empire.     Commander Gunham can be found on the steps of the Bestine capital building - willing to offer his time, and his wealth of experience as a pilot recruiter.     Also, Commander Zhanks has volunteered to spread the word in Kor Vella, Corellia. You will find him welcoming new recruits in the lobby of the Kor Vella hotel.    And finally, our key recruitment officer, Commander Landau, will be on-duty at the steps of Theed Palace until further notice.     Visit one of these recruiters or your local Imperial Pilot trainer today!

Although this does significantly affect the economic status of free pilots throughout the galaxy, the wisdom of our beloved Emperor cannot, and should not be challenged under any circumstances.     Since we received the order we have worked diligently to place our pilots within honorable organizations that support the Empire and its good works. I am quite proud to say that literally ALL of our constituent members have been offered paid positions within the Naboo Royal Security Forces, CorSec, and a handful of independent shipping organizations.     Of course, all top skilled pilots should find their home in the Imperial Navy - prosecuting the war against the dread 'rebellion.' Those who do not meet the criteria for joining the Imperial Navy should come see us! We can get you placed in a job where you are paid well for doing what you love to do!     We are holding a Pilots' Reception at the Bestine Hotel on Tatooine.    Please come by and chat, or visit a member of the Freelance Pilots' Guild near you!
