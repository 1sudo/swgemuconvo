Due to the limited number of these paintings created, it is the constant target of many thefts. The serial number for this particular painting is 103/3000.  \"High Commander T'lnia\" - Painting  A highly-praised painting of the High Commander T'lnia of the CorSec Security Force. This pictorial was created to commemorate the passing of this great leader in the Battle of Yavin4. Only a few of these paintings had been created before the Empire labeled the design, and ideal, \"illegal\". The serial number for this artwork is 2/35.  \"Lady T'lnia\" - Painting  The second of the series \"The T'lnia Family\". Wife to the High Commander T'lnia, the Lady T'lnia fought by her lover's side in the Battle of Yavin4. Legend says the Lady T'lnia was a part of the Jedi Order, schooling young force-sensitive children how to harness their power to defeat the forces of evil. Again, the Empire deemed this particular painting \"illegal\" immediately after its first debut. The serial number for this painting is 5/40.  \"Generic Advertisement\" - Painting  A painting depicting a common space scene, with a station orbiting a planet. This painting is used as a generic \"welcome\" to all who visit. It can be found in cantinas, more commonly. There seems to be no serial number.  \"Transport Ship\" - Painting  Used for teaching engineers, this painting is often hung in the worker's stations, providing a detailed representation of a Transport Ship. No serial number is attached to this painting.  \"Fighter Pilot\" - Painting  \"A dedication to all the proud fighter pilots in our galaxy\" is inscribed on the frame of the painting. The serial number is 2163/10000.  \"Red-Thread\" rug - Rug  Made from dyed bantha hair, this rug is praised for its craftsmanship and is used to characterize many a home. We currently have twelve of these rugs in our cargo. They seem to be quite popular.  \"Soft Fiber\" rug - Rug  Incredibly soft to the touch, this rug comes in a rustic color. Only the more wealthy folk seem to be able to afford this rug as it is very rare and takes many years to complete.

It was a different assignment than we were used to. Because my team and I are fluent in the knowledge of molecular anthropology, we were assigned to examine a new strain of copper that we're now calling 'Conductive Borcarbitic Copper'. At this time, we're trying to discover its origin. One of the members of the O.S.S. Guild of Area D-502 found a particularly odd artifact with the molecules of this particular copper attached to it. It's truly fascinating. The O.S.S. Guild of Area D-502 (they actually like to be called just plain \"Junk Dealers\") found the artifact in the Wall of Dantooine, fused, or half melted, to an asteroid. There could be more of this Conductive Borcarbitic Copper out there, but the \"Junk Dealers\" only care about the artifacts. With an alliance, both of our establishments could receive what they hope to find from the Wall of Dantooine. We'll see how it goes. In the meantime, we'll continue to study the new strain of copper. So far it seems resistant to our Ion laser tests. See future correspondence about these particular tests.

The asteroid field is rich with this new strain of copper. The samples were melted down to produce a ball of copper with which we were able to conduct several tests on. In fact, even the melting process of the samples was able to give us an idea of how powerful this new copper could be. It was able to resist high temperatures of heat. We think the copper could be used as a great component for creating shields for a starship. See following tests for more information on attributes.  Subject: Conductive Borcarbitic Copper Test 2: Blaster Description: On our second run, we extracted another sample from the asteroids of the Wall of Dantooine. Again, we melted the samples to produce a lump at which we could fire with a normal blaster. Odd occurrence, however, as the copper easily melted this time whereas before it took several hours to produce a lump on which we could conduct our tests. It seems Conductive Borcarbitic Copper has a large range in the resource quality spectrum. We're going to continue our experiments.  * Note: I've gathered notes from various scientists regarding our new copper. They were each given a sample on which to conduct their own private tests.

I plan to go back with a few of my friends and poke around. So far, I've found tidbits and clues to the stories surrounding these areas.  It's truly fascinating.  098.456 - Crash Site (4746, 13, 2077)  From the overgrown remains, I was able to recover a datadisk that happened to be in a undisturbed lockbox. What a lucky find, I thought! The disk was badly damaged from the crash, but I was able to extract a chunk of information from it with hours of effort. The crash site was of a starship, named 'the Jade Starunner', and belonged to a war hero, Vendi Kjleno. Unfortunately, I couldn't find enough information about the war hero, only that he was in the Battle of Yavin4. Attempting to escape from Imperial threat in the Endor System, the war hero couldn't shake the Imperial officer and met his doom, crashing on the lovely green moon. Sudden, heavy rainfall prevented me from spending anymore time at this particular site.  076.290 - Imperial Survey Party (2663, 1, -4127)  A difficult find, indeed. Hidden in a copse of dense trees, I found this particular site after falling down a steep hill, crashing face first into the small river below. Interestingly enough, this site seems fairly new. I can't imagine an assignment that would send Imperial officers to such an uncharted area. The minimal amount of damage indicates that the creatures responsible were small. (Ewoks?) I am unsure if the Gorax are in the area, but the damage would be far spread if it was, indeed, a Gorax responsible.  045.709 - Solitary Hutt (-1795, 396, 6014)  An evil looking place. Skulls of past victories litter this site, casting a haunting aura and providing a perfect place for the Korga to mingle. On Endor, I find myself crawling to the top of rocky hills just to see what might be beyond the ridge. Imagine my surprise when, on reaching the top of a particularly treacherous hill of loose rock, I am immediately attacked by Korga. I barely left with my skin in tact. I was able, while fleeing for my life, to get a quick glance of the area. Again, this will be one of those sites I return to with a horde of friends.  I'll continue to find interesting areas. Adventure is my life.  Tinrilo \"Adventi\" x'Rilsam Explorer Extraordinaire ",	"loot_tatooine_series_tinrilo":"[Translating .. ... ..]  Ah.. my calling; to adventure. This log marks my first exploration, in a series of many, of the Tatooine planet. I'm here to find those little pieces of history we often forget and have left behind. Each moment of our lives leaves a footprint for others to follow, windows through which one can taste a piece of what we have experienced. Tatooine is rich with history and I'm here to uncover it. Dodging the common horrors of the planet, I hope to come out in one piece and with a little more information about the world around us.   But who really am I? I am Tinrilo \"Adventi\" x'Rilsam, self-proclaimed Explorer Extraordinaire. Of course, I was not always an explorer. I've recently retired from the Royal Security Forces on Naboo, having served in many battles, wars and gruesome memories I'd like to forget. I'm old in age and in spirit, although more so the latter; I've lived my life and I've seen great things. I've seen my children thrive, peace achieved. I'm an old veteran of life. Finally, I can turn my eye to my passion and dedicate the rest of my existence to it. History... those fine threads of the past we often severe, delicate tunnels to the fading memories just beyond our reach. Bah! Enough of my ramblings. Let's see what we find today. Destination... Tatooine!  230.341 - Spy's Haven (5943, 180, -3828)  Equipped with expensive computers and gadgets, I found what I'd like to call \"Spy's Haven\" while exploring the deserts in the south eastern area, near Mos Eisley. While approaching, I could see the jawa closing in, barely able to keep their tricky little hands to themselves as the computers went about their business. Obviously, the site was \"fresh\". I assumed it had only been abandoned for one, maybe two days. Even with my advanced slicing skills, the computers refused to release their information. I'm going to assume that members of the Alliance were stationed here before run off by the local wild life. On to more interesting subjects..  456.076 - Mosor's Maze (-3043, 0, -5127)  I nearly smacked into Mosor's Maze while trying to escape the local wildlife on my speeder. The bowcats are indeed a fickle, dangerous creature. I was able to duck into the mouth of the maze and hide while the bowcats past me by. Luckily, this trusty maze had been here when I needed it. I remember playing here as a kid, getting lost for hours. To rekindle the memories (history in of itself!), I decided to test it out myself. Unlike my childhood, I was able to get out of the maze easily. Ah, the memories.. Rumor tells us the story behind such a design of the imagination, although not a happy story at best. It is said Mosor came home from war and found his wife with his best officer, Polen. Previously, Polen had to be dismissed due to an \"accident\". Enraged, Mosor had the maze built as a monument to his promise of revenge. It was on the night of its completion that Mosor drugged his wife and her lover on Vasarian Brandy, dragging them to the maze in the whispering darkness of the night. He sealed them in thereafter, leaving them to die in the heat of Tatooine merciless gaze. The walls of the maze have since been brought down, but no corpses were found. Are the rumors true? Or was it just a tale our mothers told us to keep us out of there? I guess we'll never know.  076.341 - Hero's Grave (-3675, 38, -1649)  The Hero's Grave. I received the location from a friend of mine who also retired to pursue history. Clues left by the keepers of this site tell us it is a grave, belonging to some of the first settlers of Tatooine. Small graves surround a center stone which we believe may house the remains of the leader. Much is unknown about this place.. Unfortunately, any evidence left from history, save from the small carvings in the rocks, has been stolen long ago and only tall stones remain as a testament to their glory and achievements.  For now, we leave Tatooine. I am headed to Naboo while my partner in history is traveling to Dathomir. I wish him well and safety.  Tinrilo \"Adventi\" x'Rilsam Explorer Extraordinaire ",	"loot_naboo_series_tinrilo":"[Translating.. ... ...]  I've lived most my life on this green planet. Naboo is a calm, peaceful place. But it always hasn't been so. War struck the planet many years ago, before my time. I'm glad it's still here. I couldn't have picked a better place to spend my life. Perfect for one who would like to live out his or her days in solitude with a backdrop of indescribable beauty. My friend, Pisk, has left for Dathomir. We've decided to meet up at the cantina in Bestine after our explorations have been drawn to a close.  I'll have to trust him when he says he'll be safe. Hm.. bah! Onto the tour of Naboo, my home planet.  104.923 - Dark Prophet and the Altar of Evil (-1636, 0, -4033)  Hm... silly title for a place emitting an unnatural evil. I approached the monument quietly, having seen the glimmer of a dark figure in the distance. A lone man, silhouetted by the birth of night, stood quietly, staring at the altar for quite some time. Despite my continuing approach, he did not even bother to notice me. I wondered what his story was, but didn't dare to ask. The eerie existence of the lifeless statues, the ever-burning flame casting a dance of light and shadow across the stone surfaces, never thwarted the beauty of the rolling hills and the happy fluttering of blue butterflies. Unfortunately, the unraveling of this place would have to wait. I don't think anyone would like to fight toe-to-toe with a dark prophet.  089.244 - Lone Droideka (-630, 0, 3982)  One of the many remnants to the Clone Wars. A fierce warrior, the droideka rolled into battle, popping up and emitting energy shields which helped aide them against the Gungan advancements. I'm surprised the droid hasn't been taken and is still here among the nature and the flowers of Naboo. Many here hold history sacred and it is why I love this planet so dearly. I wonder what this particular droideka saw in its lifetime? Now, it lays here, apart of the world and among other articles of discarded 'trash'. Nothing, in my mind, is trash.. it's all a part of history.  101.561 - Ongoing Struggle (963, 261, -1346)  The Galactic Civil War... now, that's history for you. Throughout the galaxy, you'll find many pockets of strife pertaining to this ongoing phenomenon. On Naboo, I was able to find this one. I was amazed to find it still crawling with inhabitants and my surprise was what nearly gave me away to the Alliance. Another site I won't be able to readily explore. I'll try again later, I suppose. However, from my vantage point I could see many skulls peppering the landscape. It seemed to have been a brutal battle from what I could see. It was a brief visit nonetheless, but a point of interest I'll visit again.  My plan was to visit Rori next, but I think I'll stick to the main planets for now. I'll have to visit them at another date. My next destination is Corellia, home of the Alliance.

Don't ask me how I got this communication account from the Ghrag Chancellor. It wasn't easy! Every minute I'm with him, I am reminded of the terrible circumstances that brought me here! My father. I miss him so much. I wish I could go home.   After rations yesterday, I was escorted past the Ghrag command ship's plasma core. They were doing maintenance in the main corridor, so we had to take the long way. I swear to you I was inches from leaping into that plasma core and destroying this whole gang of thugs! Certainly this would have meant my own destruction - but considering the horrors that this 'fighting clan' is perpetrating on the civilians of Kashyyyk, it would be well worth it!  But, as I sit here writing to you, I must face the fact that I am not that sort of person. I have to hold out hope that my chance for escape will come, and that I can retrieve the records that will exonerate my father and let us run back to the safety of the Empire.

We intercepted the human Master Yyng and his fair daughter on their way to the Imperial base. As you predicted, their vessel was loaded with 'Nova Breaker' booster prototypes. I had Yyng and the heiress imprisoned aboard my cruiser and replaced Yyng's pilot with one of our droids. >>       The arrogant Master Yyng has made more than his share of enemies over the years. The Independent mercenaries he hired to escort him to Kashyyyk were very happy to cooperate with us!  << On 19-G6f, Guimas wrote: We sabotaged the boosters by putting thermal detonators inside the component casing and wiring the triggers to the mix-chamber. The Imperials accepted this shipment of sabotaged components like fools! They immediately installed them, took flight, and then exploded into a million tiny pieces! >>       I wish I could have been there to see it! According to our agent, everyone on-board the Imperial base believes that Master Yyng has done this as a display of defiance. Yyng is death-marked! The Empire is sending word of this to Bounty Hunters throughout the galaxy. When you deliver him to his cell, remind him of this fact.       You may also want to remind the Master engineer that his daugher will remain alive only so long as he cooperates. I expect him to deliver a superior 'Nova Breaker' booster immediately! Do not allow him to sleep until this is done.       Many thanks for your outstanding work, Guimas Thkrall! You have proven once again that you are the only mercenary in this fighting clan that I can really trust.
