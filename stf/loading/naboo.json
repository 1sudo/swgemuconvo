		"naboo":"Many believe no other planet in the known galaxy is as beautiful as Naboo.  A lush, vibrant world, Naboo has two indigenous peoples: the Naboo and the Gungans.  Long-standing tensions between the Naboo and Gungans have eased in the generation since they worked together to defeat the Trade Federation.",	"theed":"The crown jewel of Naboo, Theed is the cultural and political capital of the planet. Artists from around the galaxy flock to Theed to partake of the rich, creative atmosphere.   The Grand Plaza in the city center offers impressive sights of both the Royal Arch and Theed Palace.  ",	"deeja_peak":"Nestled deep within a mountain valley, Dee'ja Peak is a secluded town, catering to those who wish to get away from it all.  Many residents of Dee'ja Peak wish to live an independent lifestyle, or don't agree with the Queen's support of the Empire.  Dee'ja Peak welcomes everyone, for residents know it's a long way to get there, but well worth the view.",	"lake_retreat":"The Lake Retreat, as it is known, was originally the family home of Naboo's former ruler, Queen Amidala.  With a gazebo built on the waters of the placid lake, the Lake Retreat is the site of many wedding ceremonies.  Given to the Monarchy of Naboo, it is now reserved for the private use of friends, family, and loyal subjects.",	"emperors_retreat":"It is rumored that the Emperor keeps a Retreat on Naboo, a place to which he goes when he wishes to contemplate the future of the Empire.  The stories also say that the Emperor's highest commanders receive their orders from him here.  If this is indeed true, the Retreat would presumably be hidden and heavily guarded by the most elite stormtroopers.",	"gungan_sacred_place":"Hidden deep within the swamps, the Sacred Place is the most holy site of the Gungans. The only non-Gungan visitors allowed are the recognized friends and allies of the Gungan people.  During the reign of Queen Amidala, an alliance between the Naboo and the Gungans was forged here.  ",	"theed_palace":"The most elegant and beautiful building complex on Naboo, Theed Palace is where the elected Kings and Queens of Naboo hold court.  From Grand Ballrooms to stunning views of Theed's waterfalls, the Palace is a fitting home for royalty.",	"gungan":"In the past, Gungans took great pains to avoid contact with their Naboo neighbors, and even built huge underwater cities to escape contact.  Since the failed invasion by the Trade Federation, the Gungans have begun to co-exist with their human friends. A few stubborn holdouts remain on both sides. ",	"fambaa":"This gigantic sauropod is herbivorous and even-tempered by nature, but fearsome in its appearance.  Fambaa have been domesticated by the Gungans, and carry huge loads such as immense shield generators used by the Gungans.   While moving underwater, the Gungans abandoned small groups of fambaa, which eventually established their own packs.",	"falumpaset":"These highly intelligent, powerful creatures roam the swamps and plains of the planet in great herds.  The falumpaset is a gigantic quadruped with a distinctive bellowing call that carries for kilometers around.  Falumpasets are domesticated and used as beasts of burden by the Gungans.  However, their temperament is uniformly stubborn and uncooperative.",	"kaadu":"These agile, fleet-footed, flightless birds are as fast in the water as they are on land.  They are the preferred mount of Gungan soldiers.  The kaadu lay their eggs on land, often in fields, where predators like the peko-peko often eat them.  Fearless creatures, the kaadu will viciously protect their herd if attacked.",	"narglatch":"The narglatch is often a solitary hunter that silently stalks and quickly demolishes its prey.  Densely padded feet aid in hunting with stealth, and their large claws are superior killing tools.  It generally avoids deep water, although narglatches are good swimmers if pressed.",	"peko_peko":"Peko-pekos are large, strong reptavians whose great raucous squawks carry over long distances.  A long tail and spectacular coloration make this creature distinctive and valuable. Among the Gungans the peko-peko is admired for its beauty, whereas the Naboo hunt them for their indigo-sapphire skin.",	"tusk_cat":"Fierce hunters, tusk-cats stalk their prey in a variety of different terrains, attacking with claws and namesake tusks.  Over the years the Naboo have domesticated tusk-cats, using them as both riding animals and for herding livestock.",	"emperor_palpatine":"As a politician in the Old Republic, Emperor Palpatine gained political power using the corruption of the senate as a springboard to his own goals.  Using his political savvy, he gained control of the senate and promised to restore order to the galaxy.     He is now the supreme head of the Empire, and oversees all planets under Imperial control.    Widespread resistance to his rule has recently erupted into a full-scale Galactic Civil War.",	"darth_vader":"His past as mysterious as the black helmet he wears, Darth Vader is the Emperor's foremost agent.  Vader is known across the Galaxy as the hero who single-handedly defeated the Jedi Knights, enforcers of the corrupt Old Republic.   Vader is charged with ferreting out and destroying Rebels.  When he has succeeded, the Emperor will restore peace to the galaxy.",	"lord_hethrir":"Lord Hethrir holds the office of Procurator of Justice.  It is his burden to ensure that justice is brought to those who have wronged the Empire.  Lord Hethrir mainly presides over cases that involve Rebel acts of terrorism.  Lord Hethrir claims that his zeal for justice derives from the destruction of his homeworld by Rebels using a biological weapon.",	"kaja_orzee":"A strong yet friendly woman, Kaja Or'Zee believes fully in the Empire.  She feels that the New Order will restore peace to the galaxy.  As Head Chamberlain to the Emperor, Kaja sees to it that the Emperor's will is realized.  Disheartened by reports that Rebels destroyed Alderaan, Kaja Or'Zee feels it's her duty to help the Empire win the Galactic Civil War.",	"loam_redge":"Loam Redge has risen through the ranks of the Empire to the position of Chief Inquisitor.  Known for being a stern, yet fair man, Loam is quite effective in retrieving information from dissidents and criminals alike.",	"kadaara":"A major center of commerce, Kaadara has also become a hub for the criminal element (such as it is on Naboo).   Smugglers, mercenaries and bounty hunters are common here, so steer clear of the seedier areas if there's a price on your head.",	"moenia":"The Empire views Moenia as little more than an artists' retreat and virtually ignores all activity in the city. This has allowed the formation of a small, but influential group of political idealists sympathetic to the Rebellion.",	"keren":"The most important trading city on Naboo, Keren is a bustling mercantile hub. Planetary as well as interstellar traders can be found here, amid a wide assortment of (mostly) legal goods and products.  Look here to line up business contacts or a good deal."
