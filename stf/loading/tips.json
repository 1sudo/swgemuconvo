You'll know that all the options have shown up once the menu stops animating.",	"postures":"You can kneel, sit, stand, or lay prone in Star Wars Galaxies. These all provide different defensive benefits and penalties when in combat. For example, laying prone will increase your accuracy when firing, but will make you very vulnerable to melee attacks.",	"movement":"Moving around in combat makes you much harder to hit, but it will also spoil your aim. You can see how accurate your shots will be by looking at the number displayed to the left of your target's status, over their head.",	"toolbar":"If you want to make a shortcut for using an item, you can simply drag the item from your inventory into your toolbar. For example, to make a shortcut for drawing your weapon, you can drag your blaster to an empty toolbar slot.

When chase cam is on, the camera will automatically lock to the back of your head.

Green means the target is easily defeated. Blue means the fight will be challenging. White means the target has equivalent skills to you and the fight will be a close one.  If the mark is yellow or orange, fighting this creature will be a dangerous proposition. If the mark is red or purple, the enemy is too dangerous to attack on your own right now.  ",	"states":"Some enemies may use an attack that puts your character into a \"state.\"  States are conditions that can be applied to you, such as dizziness or blindness.

Neither NPCs nor other players can see your personal light, so don't worry about it attracting unwanted attention.",	"radial_shortcut":"You can instantly bring up a radial menu on your current target by pressing the tilde key ~.

Go to the second floor of a medical center and see the cybernetics expert to replace the faulty part with one that works properly.",	"combat_queue":"The combat queue lets you see what combat commands you are getting ready to execute.
