",	"or":"or",	"harassment_message":"Please read this entire message and at the end of the text you will find a button that will take you to the ticket submission form.  Community Standards information, please review the following guidelines before submitting Community Standards tickets.  Please use the \"community standards\" categories only for reporting the various types of issues outlined below.  Inappropriate use of community standards categories can result in tickets being closed that must be resubmitted with the appropriate categories and repeated misuse can result in actions being taken against users' accounts.  Harassment Harassment is defined as specifically targeting another player or group of players to harm or inconvenience them.  Harassment can take many forms and often what is seen as harassment by one person or group is perfectly acceptable game play.  An example of this in Star Wars is the way Bounty Hunter players hunt Jedi players (of course there may be cases where a Bounty Hunter player may specifically target a single Jedi player, this would be considered harassment and is not allowed.  Bounty Hunter players should not specifically target the same Jedi over and over).  Additionally, if someone calls you a bad name or offends you in any way, please first attempt to resolve the issue by using the built in features (/addignore, /filter) between the parties involved.  The ignore and language filter features provided in-game will help you to control and avoid most harassment.  Should you be unable to resolve the issue, please submit an in-game harassment ticket as a last course of action and the in-game staff will assist you. Remember, if you feel you are the target of harassment, please make sure that you do a /report <offending player name>.  This will send us the relavent chat data and log it to our servers for secure review.  Language For all issues of inappropriate language in game, a player report is needed by using the report command; /report <offending player name>.  This will capture and send us the revelant chat data and log it to our servers for secure review.  For cases of mild and sporadic profanity, please make use of the features already in the game to ignore or block profanity.  The profanity filter (/filter) will garble most profanity, and is defaulted to on.  Should you decide to turn this filter off, you are deciding that mild profanity is of no concern to you.  If this is not the case, please turn the filter back on to prevent viewing of most profanity.  Parents allowing children to play the game should always ensure that the profanity filter is on at all times, as the game is rated T (Teen).  The Ignore list (/addignore <player name>) will add any player to your list that will block any spatial messages, private messages, group messages, or emotes.  You will only see the in-game avatar one that player is added. Please do report severe cases of profane language, sexual/racial abuse, or hate mongering.  Trade Fraud The /report <player name> command, although primarily used to report issues of harassment and language, is the preferred medium for recording a verbal agreement or \"contract\" between two players for buffing, items for credits, items to have repairs, slicing, ect. conducted on them.  This will send us the relevant data and log it to our servers for secure review.  These agreements must be logged for Customer Service to take any action should a deal go bad.  Unfortunately, without proof of the agreement, we are unable to assist in these issues.  Kill Stealing Star Wars Galaxies does not recognize NPC/creature ownership for the point of attaining experience or gaining loot.  Corpse permissions are granted to the player/group that inflicts the most damage to the NPC/creature in question.  Additionally, we do not recognize any camp claims.  Customer Service will not be able to assist with claims of Kill Stealing.  We do however encourage players to play nice together and ask that everyone respect those already engaged in combat and only join in the attack if being asked for help.  Exploitation All incidents of exploitation should be reported immediately for an in game support to assist.  A CSR must be able to physically witness the exploitation in game.  Inappropriate Player Names Please report any inappropriate names you see while playing.  We also don't want to see them and will change the more severe names quickly.  In-Game Mail All issues of verbal abuse and/or harassment experienced through the in-game mail system can be reported by using /report <offending player name> command or /report <system> command.  Please be sure to have the offending mail open prior to submitting the player report.  Evidence Forum posts, eye witness testimonies, video footage, screenshots, player chat logs, and 3rd party website posts are not allowed as collaborating evidence in any of the above situations.  For further information on any of the above topics, please reference the Game Rules at the official website, or FAQs contained in our knowledge base articles.
