Bye.",	"s_257d7def":"You can find these thugs hanging around and being a nuisance.  Keep in mind talking with them is an exhausted option.  I wouldn't approach any of them without a blaster at my hip. ",	"s_2ae116f8":"What is in it for me?",	"s_40708207":"Have you got the disk?",	"s_41ec1c94":"Sorry, it's a bad habit.  How can I help?",	"s_464748ae":"I am willing to help, where do I start?",	"s_4e6ee0cd":"The rich get richer. Too true. So that means I should become one of the rich.",	"s_4f53003d":"I should have expected as much. The stench of failure surrounds you... which I foolishly thought could be overcome. No chance.",	"s_53e9175a":"Would you have returned the disk had you known the contents were worth well over six million credits?  Didn't think so.    Move along and learn from your mistakes.",	"s_6151c35f":"Can I trust you with some information?",	"s_6b8c7e69":"You did. If there's nothing in this for me, I'm gone.",	"s_873db52a":"Don't expect a welcoming party; like I said before, I wouldn't approach them without a blaster on your hip. When you get the disk, bring it back to me.",	"s_9f213941":"What type of supplies?",	"s_a082f8ab":"Don't feel so bad... it's all to a good cause. My bank account! Ha!",	"s_a6cac2af":"With questions like that you might as well join their ranks, I must have read you wrong.",	"s_b84b366c":"How can I help?",	"s_b9bc27b2":"Sure enough.  I thought it was going to be a challenge.",	"s_c0a878d5":"Indeed. Then fare thee well. No... make that fare thee poorly.",	"s_c7676f2f":"Spice!  You said it was foods and medicine!",	"s_d1008bcb":"What is the problem? Have you done what I've asked?",	"s_dbc40340":"I knew I could see the spirit in your eyes.  You can find these thugs hanging around and harassing people.   Keep in mind talking with them is an exhausted option.  I wouldn't approach any of them without a blaster at my hip. ",	"s_ddb27082":"Not yet, but I'm working on it.",	"s_df607c49":"I'm listening.",	"s_e8f293a0":"I knew I could see the spirit in your eyes.  You can find these thugs hanging around and causing trouble.    Keep in mind talking with them is an exhausted option.  I wouldn't approach any of them without a blaster at my hip. ",	"s_eaa416f0":"There is a fairly large group of thugs here in town.  One of them is holding onto a crucial data disk, on which the location of a huge stock of stolen supplies is stored.",	"s_edb238bc":"Go on.",	"s_f3df0aae":"Medicine, and foods mostly.",	"s_f485390d":"Good show, all this spice is going to fetch a pretty penny.  See you around.",	"s_fae10b21":"I've been working my whole life, and have very little to show for it.    More and more of the money I make is being used to line the pockets of the rich.  There is little I can do by myself, which is why I am asking you for help. "
