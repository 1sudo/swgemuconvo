",	"s_14":"Were you expecting me?",	"s_16":"Come back when you are done. But do hurry, these herbs lose their potency if their harvest and proper storage is delayed too long.",	"s_17":"You have been very good. As promised, here is your treat.",	"s_18":"Ah yes, you're back! And just in time, I have more herbs I need gathered. Are you ready to go, now?",	"s_19":"Yes.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Now be good and go gather those herbs.",	"s_21":"Of course, I am!  Oh, I understand, you must be simpleminded and that is why you are given the freedom to run these little errands. I'll explain in small words.",	"s_23":"I'm listening.",	"s_25":"I use special plants to make special things. Those plants must be found and gathered for me. You have come to gather them and store them. Understand?",	"s_27":"How do I store them?",	"s_29":"Don't worry about that yet. Once you have the herbs I shall send you the location of the storage.",	"s_31":"Okay, I'll do it but what plants do I pick?",	"s_33":"You need to move faster if you are going to be good and earn a treat. Now let's try again, shall we?",	"s_34":"Yes",	"s_35":"Here are some simple descriptions. Gather and store the herbs, then come back and if you have been good I shall give you a nice treat. But do hurry, these herbs lose their potency if their harvest and proper storage is delayed too long.",	"s_36":"Off you go, then.",	"s_38":"I am sorry but I can't help you just now."
