Ybella Systems thanks you for your patronage. ",	"s_13f18f29":"I agree. Are there other areas of space combat you would like to discuss at the moment?",	"s_173a50a8":"If your ship is equipped with missiles, you'll be able to fire them by pressing the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON or JOYSTICK BUTTON (2). Missiles take some time to 'lock' onto their targets - so watch your targeting indicator. The spinning squares will 'lock in' and become solid when your missile is ready for release.",	"s_199da0c4":"What happens when I land?",	"s_1a22f0e7":"Excellent. Are there any other areas that interest you at the moment?",	"s_23f4b352":"How do I find stations with the zone map?",	"s_2b99ba00":"Look on the radar at the lower center area of your screen. The circular blue bars surrounding the radar indicate your shield strength. The center red circle shows your armor strength. As you lose shielding, the blue bars shrink. As you lose armor, the red circle also shrinks.",	"s_2e9195ac":"Welcome to the Ybella Systems 'Starfighter Training' holodisc program. Press the ALT key on your keyboard to activate your mouse cursor, then select one of the training options below to begin. Press the ESC key to skip this training sequence. Press the ALT key again to return to flight mode.",	"s_306c1aa":"Shields.",	"s_353c0343":"It varies. You will have the option of repairing all of your ship damage or a select percentage of overall damage. The more you want to repair, the greater the cost. Space stations routinely stock up on low-grade parts and have trouble making repairs to exotic machinery.",	"s_36ba2186":"I understand ship weapons.",	"s_3e07db47":"How do I roll my ship?",	"s_3ec6b879":"Landing procedures.",	"s_43401557":"Open the zone map by pressing the 'N' key. Space stations, points of interest, waypoints and mission critical objects are listed by category on the right-hand side of the screen. Click on the 'Space Stations' category then click on the space station of your choice.",	"s_46e4ecc6":"When you are ready to land you must fly to a planetary space station and request landing clearance. Press Shift-C to target the station and open a communications frequency. Also, if you fly close to the space station's hangar the station will communicate with you automatically.",	"s_4bd64d06":"I think I understand space combat.",	"s_4bdcddad":"Armor.",	"s_4cc9a6bb":"How do I control ship heading?",	"s_4e9c20b8":"I understand targeting. Thanks.",	"s_51b1431b":"When you launch, your ship computer automatically creates a 'Launch Waypoint' to the nearest planetary station. To activate this waypoint go to your datapad by pressing Control-D, click the 'Waypoints' tab, locate the 'Launch Waypoint,' right-click and select 'Activate.' You can also locate these stations using the zone map.",	"s_55651ec5":"It is advisable to lock your target while in combat so that you can keep track of its health, distance, and relative position. Additionally, you will need to have a target selected in order to inspect it, dock with it, or to fire missiles at it. The starship targeting system allows you to acquire enemy targets, friendly targets, neutral space station targets, and other player pilots.",	"s_56daefef":"You should also be aware of the chat system in space - and its potential interaction with your flight controls. When you are piloting a ship, you must press the ENTER key to begin chat. Type your message, then hit ENTER again to send. Note that when you are in 'chat mode' your mouse mode automatically switches to 'cursor mode.' The mouse will return to flight mode when you hit ENTER to send your message.",	"s_5d06faf2":"I think I understand ship movement.",	"s_5d8dd52b":"I don't doubt that. What other areas would you like to discuss today?",	"s_5e014e82":"I know enough about space stations now.",	"s_5ef040d8":"Okay. Let's talk about flight.",	"s_603f0296":"What about friendly ships?",	"s_6b0b0a5e":"To target the nearest friendly player-piloted starship, press the K key. To cycle friendly player pilots, use the L key. The semicolon selects the nearest friendly non-player-piloted starships, and the apostrophe key cycles through them.",	"s_6b96b4b0":"Use the mouse (or a joystick) to change your ship's heading. The up / down axis on your mouse controls the ship pitch while the left / right axis controls the ship's lateral turn or 'yaw.'",	"s_6d152f2a":"I know enough about landing now.",	"s_6de416e5":"Disable Training Permanently",	"s_6f13ef54":"When you are close to the space station, target and communicate with it by pressing Shift-C. After this, you will be able to request ship repairs or land on the planet below.",	"s_6f4feb49":"How much do repairs cost?",	"s_70":"I know enough about landing now.",	"s_717ffa5d":"Starship weapons",	"s_72":"Excellent. What else would you like to discuss?",	"s_73b3d88d":"Tell me about damage.",	"s_757a074a":"Use the up and down arrow keys for throttle control. Up arrow - speed up. Down arrow - slow down. You can also set your speed to maximum with the 'home' key - or set it to zero with the 'end' key.",	"s_759c9273":"If you are flying with the mouse, you need to be aware of your mouse mode. Use the ALT key to toggle between mouse modes. In mouse-flight mode, the cursor changes to a light blue virtual-joystick indicator, and your mouse movements control the ship heading. In mouse-cursor mode, you will see a yellow arrow cursor which can be used to interact with elements on your heads-up display.",	"s_784cfb1e":"Countermeasures.",	"s_7980ca09":"Discuss space combat.",	"s_7e90f3fa":"How do I know my shield or armor strength?",	"s_81":"Skip Training",	"s_82":"Affirmative.

When you have a ship target selected, you can use the [ and ] bracket keys to cycle through subcomponents. Starship parts, such as the main reactor or the engine, can be targeted in this manner. Fire as normal - and your weapons will be tuned to hit the specific subcomponent so long as the sub-target remains locked.",	"s_98":"Ybella Systems strongly discourages deactivation of your starship training protocol. Please confirm your choice as this deactivation is permanent.",	"s_986a2b5e":"Your ship will be parked at the starport of the city at which you chose to land.

Or if you want to relax a bit, right-click on the station name and choose 'Autopilot.' Your ship will fly there automatically.",	"s_aba0472f":"Your primary starship blaster weapon is fired by pressing either the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON (default) or the JOYSTICK BUTTON (1). Be sure to aim for the small bright blue circle just in front of a moving target. This is your 'target lead indicator' that calculates the target speed vector.",	"s_abd54560":"Good. Is there anything else you want to know about?",	"s_b440102e":"Where do I find a space station?",	"s_b5d951d6":"I know enough about this now.",	"s_b8768b9a":"What do I do when I reach the station?",	"s_b8d366e5":"The armor layer of your ship protects your starship chassis and all of the components that it contains. Unlike shields, armor does not regenerate. You must install new armor once your old armor is destroyed.",	"s_b9916a35":"Starships carry a variety of weapons. Starship blasters (or 'flash cannons'), missiles, torpedoes, and countermeasures. Which should we discuss?",	"s_ba96a20e":"Landing is free. The planetary defense systems of all modern worlds will automatically convey you to the planet surface and secure your starship in a municipal starport hangar.",	"s_c00ac18c":"What area of damage are you interested in reviewing?",	"s_c87b607":"When an enemy fires a missile at you, you'll hear a missile warning sound as the ordnance approaches.

What else would you like to discuss?",	"s_f2293d3f":"Use the TAB key to lock the closest enemy target. Press the T key (or SHIFT-T) to cycle your target lock between enemies in the area. Use SHIFT-TAB to lock the closest enemy player target, and use the Z key (or SHIFT-Z) to cycle player enemy targets.",	"s_f29dd33b":"Shields are a damage-resistance system that recharges over time (as long as the shield generator is in good health). If your target has shields, you must destroy them before doing damage to the ship armor. Same goes for your own ship. If you lose your shields - the next hit will likely scrape off a nice chunk of armor."
