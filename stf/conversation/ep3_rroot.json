Wait, what is that? Oh no, the patrol has returned!",	"s_14":"Kymayrr! Then word made it out. I knew they would come for me.",	"s_146":"Hararok?",	"s_16":"Then let us be off.",	"s_18":"I cannot. I have around my neck a deadlock. If I stray from this area it will detonate, and take my head with it. To taunt me, they wrote the code on a rock and gave it to one of the feral wookiees that live in this region. I pleaded with him to give me the rock, but he just roared at me and ran off. But you are free. If you could get that code for me, then we could get out of here.",	"s_20":"You say one of the feral wookiees has the code?",	"s_22":"Yes, you can find them farther down the trail. And please hurry, a patrol is due to return any time now.",	"s_32":"",	"s_33":"I doubt you could help me.",	"s_4":"You are back! Did you bring the code?",	"s_8":"You stranger! You do not look like one of this lot. What would bring you down this path?"
