They have been a thorn in our side for awhile. Their ground operatives have stolen too many of our missions and goals. For some reason, their ship has been shot down by forces unknown. Looks as if they have more enemies than we thought.",	"s_24":"Droid Engineer's Cave.",	"s_248becfc":"I don't like your reasoning.",	"s_26":"Completely insane, the droid engineer creates minions for his own personal design. We cannot compete with insanity and must find means of removing him from Lok. I wish you luck in the endeavor. It won't be easy.",	"s_2f559d1":"It depends. There's the Smuggler's Ship and the Droid Engineer's cave. Which do you prefer to plunder first?",	"s_32":"Smuggler's Ship.",	"s_326fcc61":"What is your reasoning behind this?",	"s_34":"Ahh, the smugglers. They have been a thorn in our side for awhile. Their ground operatives have stolen too many of our missions and goals. For some reason, their ship has been shot down by forces unknown. Looks as if they have more enemies than we thought.",	"s_36":"Droid Engineer's Cave.",	"s_372fb7c1":"Okay, okay. What were those places again?",	"s_38":"Completely insane, the droid engineer creates minions for his own personal design. We cannot compete with insanity and must find means of removing him from Lok. I wish you luck in the endeavor. It won't be easy.",	"s_391e8a36":"I was wrong about you. You're nothing but a commoner. I don't deal with commoners. Go away!",	"s_3f395897":"Where are these enemies?",	"s_4487b6cf":"What business is it of yours? Do not question me! Had you the opportunity to become leader of your underground gang of pirates, you too would try to gain your people's trust and rid yourself of the troubles your opposition caused.",	"s_46236858":"I will offer the opportunity to someone else. Unfortunately, it will be your loss.",	"s_471ddd18":"Then help me! Help me rid Lok of my opposition so that I may become leader of my own little band of outcasts. I must earn their trust...",	"s_48566ef9":"What's in it for me?",	"s_4db27a02":"Droid Engineer's Cave.",	"s_63fbc0e4":"I agree!",	"s_657533b5":"Then leave! I have too many things to do than to waste my time.",	"s_66d367c9":"I recognize that swagger in your steps. You're an outcast like me. And, like me, you should know that opposition to your aims and goals are grounds for 'removal'. ",	"s_6cfa2fa7":"The bounty and riches of my--our!--enemy's strongholds! Just think of it; all the treasure you can fill your deep pockets with! All yours! Just destroy them.",	"s_7884d24e":"Smuggler's Ship.",	"s_7bf56007":"I don't agree with you.",	"s_8247a8b0":"Smuggler's Ship and the Droid Engineer's Cave.",	"s_9be34260":"It sounds fishy to me. No.",	"s_a66ef7ad":"I'll help you.",	"s_a9eda6c":"Excellent! You can start by either plundering the Droid Engineer's Cave or the Smuggler's Ship. Which will it be?",	"s_d17c998e":"I don't want to help you.",	"s_e4e08f1f":"Ugh! I have no time for this..",	"s_f8224468":"Completely insane, the droid engineer creates minions for his own personal design.
