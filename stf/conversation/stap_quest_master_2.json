And make it quick, I have things to do.",	"s_2":"",	"s_24":"I'm looking for a missing shipment for a trader named Saun Dann.",	"s_26":"Let me check my records. Well it says that it arrived yesterday but for some reason, it hasn't been delivered to its final location yet. That's strange, it's not in storage here either, it's been marked as missing.",	"s_40":"A busy time around here I'm afraid. You're going to have to move along.",	"s_41":"So it made it here but then mysteriously vanished?",	"s_42":"It appears that way. It's those blasted Jawas I tell you. We've had a problem with them skulking around our cargo like they own the place. We've tried to keep them out but they're like rodents!"
