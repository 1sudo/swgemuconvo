		"s_f2d3daf1":"Wha... if you do not wish to help, then so be it. But there is no call for being rude.",		"s_f0d9878f":"Yes, it is. I'm proud to say that the gungan claiming to own the land is dead.",		"s_ea2c487d":"Excellent, thank you very much.  I do appreciate this.  Here is a waypoint to the location I need you to scout out. Please remove any squatters who are loitering there.

I'll be here waiting for you once you've finished.",		"s_cc9db25e":"Stop! I'm not interested in your petty little problems.",		"s_ac5709b0":"Bah... I'll just find someone else who can clear that land for me. Leave me alone.",		"s_a1ef941b":"Sure, I'd be happy to help.",		"s_91e6aa00":"Is the area cleared?",		"s_8bf180e7":"An owner?!  That family may occupy that land, but I am it's owner.  Your sympathy is sickening.",		"s_88ac3394":"That land already has an owner. You have no right to take it from them.",		"s_7637308a":"I have a quick job for you friend.

I'm an architect and could use someone of your skill to clear some unwelcome inhabitants off of some land I just recently purchased.

Does this sound like something you could help me with?",		"s_50bf04b1":"I'm glad to hear that, construction can now begin.  Thank you for your hard work.",		"s_25d34a1e":"Sorry friend... can't talk. I'm losing money every day we fail to begin construction.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (padawan_architect_01.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
