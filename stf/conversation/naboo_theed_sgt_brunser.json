Those Mummers will not go down quietly.",	"s_34":"...but it didn't matter how many droids they sent after us, we destroyed each and every one of them. They kept on coming and we kept on destroying them.",	"s_36":"Continue with you assault on the Mummer base, trooper.",	"s_37":"Those Mummers still don't know what hit them. You do good work, trooper.",	"s_38":"Trooper, stand at ease. It's time to hit the Mummers at their base. If we, and by we I mean you, can hit them hard enough, the Mummers will be unable to consider future terrorist attacks. At least for a while, anyway.",	"s_39":"How do I begin?",	"s_40":"Start by going to their base and softening up their defenses. After that, you'll go after their leadership, but I'll let you know when to pursue that.",	"s_73":"Excellent work, trooper. The terrorists have been neutralized. I think the Mummers will be less of a problem for quite a while. Return to Pooja Naberrie and let her know your assignment against the terrorists is complete.",	"s_74":"I'll return to Pooja.",	"s_75":"Yes, of course."
