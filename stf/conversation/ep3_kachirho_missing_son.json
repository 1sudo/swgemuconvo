I just want to be left alone.",	"s_238":"I am exhausted. I cannot find any evidence of where Takook is. Maybe you have better news for me.",	"s_240":"I am afraid that the news is not good.",	"s_242":"Oh, no! You have found my son...and...and...",	"s_244":"I am sorry, but your son is dead.",	"s_246":"...How....how did this happen? He was a good hunter. I don't understand how this could happen. My poor Takook.",	"s_248":"Lobarorr killed your son and stole your spear from him.",	"s_250":"My spear? Takook was killed because of a spear? If it meant so much to Lobarorr I would have just given it to him. I always knew that Lobarorr was no good. Now he will have to face my rage and pay for taking my son away from me!",	"s_252":"Takook's final request was that the spear be retrieved and returned to you.",	"s_254":"So, you tracked down and killed Lobarorr to recover my spear. I see. You have honored my son by completing his final request. You may be an offworlder but you are honorable and noble. Thank you for returning the spear to me but I have no further need of it. I think it would be best if you kept it. Takook would have wanted it that way.",	"s_256":"Thank you. I am sorry for your loss.",	"s_258":"As am I. As am I. If you will please excuse me I need to be alone now.",	"s_260":"I still haven't been able to find Takook. We must continue the search because I am sure he is in great need of help.",	"s_262":"Offworlder! I do not wish to inconvenience you but I am in desperate need of help. My son, Takook, is missing. I beg you to please help me find him.",	"s_270":"Ok, calm down. Where did you last see your son?",	"s_272":"I saw him two days ago heading in the forest with his friend Lobarorr, who hasn't returned either. He said that they were going to do a little hunting and would be back before nightfall. I am afraid that he and Lobarorr might have been attacked by something they couldn't handle. I have been searching the woods but so far have not found any signs.",	"s_279":"I see. Is there any reason your son might have run away?",	"s_281":"No! Of course, not. My son would never do something like that. He is out there somewhere, probably injured and unable to return home. Please, I am begging you...help me find Takook.",	"s_283":"You can count on me. I will do my best to find your missing son.",	"s_285":"Thank you so much. This means a lot to me. My son is the only family I have left since the slavers took his mother and the sickness swept through my kin.",	"s_287":"I am sorry but I cannot help you right now.",	"s_289":"I understand. I shall continue my search for Takook on my own.",	"s_291":"I am sorry but I am afraid I have to be going.",	"s_293":"Of course. I am ashamed that I put my troubles on the shoulders of a complete stranger. Forget I said anything.",	"s_32":"Rrowww. Grrrrr. Rorrorroww."
