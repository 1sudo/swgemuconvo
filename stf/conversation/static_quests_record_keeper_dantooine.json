		"s_ff20b1f1":"Yes, please reset my employment history.",		"s_f51b07ff":"What kind of questions?",		"s_eef03120":"We believe the Rebel scum attacked our database with a virus. It erased a lot of the progress that adventurers like yourself have done for citizens here on Tatooine.",		"s_edb238bc":"Go on.",		"s_e8ad81f2":"If I reset your file, you will be able to go back and assist citizens on Tatooine again as you have done in the past. But don't worry, you will be rewarded, and it will in no way reduce your standing in the eyes of the public or any organizations you're assosciated with. Shall I reset your file?",		"s_e61fd069":"What if I decide to fill in the missing information in my file?",		"s_e3c4a3d5":"No, do not reset my history. I will continue my service.",		"s_d0902f5e":"YES, I am sure. It will be fun to help those citizens again.",		"s_cd1a9013":"My job is to update these records to their former standard, if citizens so wish, or to blank them out completely and let them start over on a clean slate.",		"s_cc924cf1":"Yes, please reset my file.",		"s_bfd7fb6d":"Can I decide later?",		"s_b8ea8b67":"Very well, it is done. Thank you for updating my records citizen. Now move along.",		"s_b1f6ba02":"What if I decide to erase all my data?",		"s_ae08bd89":"Very well citizen, it is done. Thank you for saving me the time to update your records. Now move along.",		"s_ab18ccf6":"Keep in mind that once I reset your file, it cannot be undone. Are you sure that you want me to blank out your databank?",		"s_a87d342e":"I must recompile all of the data that was lost, if you so wish. For that reason, I must ask you some questions.",		"s_a76f22bf":"What if I decide to reset my history?",		"s_9ef848f9":"I will answer your questions.",		"s_9413f709":"Citizen, I'm a very busy person. Please move on.",		"s_884006f7":"If you like, I can just erase your progress, you would save me a lot of time and you could go around and help citizens all over again, with them rewarding you appropriately. Otherwise, you can update my records with your old progress and go on as nothing happened. Remember that once you decide, you cannot change your mind. Shall I erase the information in your databank?",		"s_83c0df9e":"Then you will just continue where you were. Any missions for citizens that you are currently doing will stay as they are and citizens you're already done helping, will have records of that. But remember that once you decide you cannot change your mind. Shall I reset your history?",		"s_71a41175":"I've finally met someone with less patience than me. Fine, move along.",		"s_710595f4":"I've got to be going now.",		"s_6de63882":"You are wasting my time citizen but fine, return to me when you have made your decision. Now move along.",		"s_6d50e348":"I want to decide later.",		"s_5db2d1c9":"YES, I am sure. I want to continue where I left of.",		"s_5c12e6ea":"Greetings citizen. My records indicate that you have been assisting fellow citizens and officials around Tatooine. Unfortunately, our databank had a 'accident', and I need to ask you some questions to fill in the blanks.",		"s_4b10b47":"You should make time for a official of the Empire but I have a lot to do anyway so come back when you have time.",		"s_3d27cb3d":"Very well. But do not take long, my time is valuable.",		"s_3b67eeac":"Remember that once you decide to update your files and continue as normal, you cannot change your mind. Are you sure that you want me to update your record?",		"s_32bfa453":"I think we are done with each other citizen. I explained that you couldn't change your mind. Now move along.",		"s_2e18346d":"I don't have time right now.",		"s_287908df":"No, do not reset my file. I will update your records.",		"s_14693cf1":"What if I decide to continue my service?",		"s_12936cce":"I see. How do we proceed?",		"s_1288f6ef":"NO, wait. Let me think about it for a second.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (static_quests_record_keeper_dantooine.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
