		"s_f688af52":"Move along... oh, it's you again. Why haven't you used that list I gave... er... I mean, that you found... against Victor? Arrrgh! I was in a good mood after giving that to you, but now I'm upset again. Just go take care of it already.",		"s_f62e5a7d":"Ah, you're back. Do you have enough room this time to get your precious evidence?",		"s_e50dbfc0":"Fine. I'm leaving.",		"s_da9a29e9":"No, not yet.",		"s_d638d2ec":"Move along.",		"s_d2df4599":"I could help you... if you had enough room. Come back when you do and we'll talk.",		"s_ce8d51fb":"Look-oh? Looking for evidence, are you? I may be able to help with that. It would be a perfect opportunity to get even with that Victor fellow. Never mind the details. Here, you might find this... 'list' entertaining. Be sure to say that you 'found' it.",		"s_c1bf1629":"You'd be wise to join the Empire. The Rebel Alliance and its members have spiraled out of control. We're going to stomp them out of existence.",		"s_b9b27823":"Thank you.",		"s_99ef56dc":"No, you don't. Again, come back when you do.

Otherwise... move along, citizen.",		"s_6ddb06b2":"And here you are. Now... get lost.",		"s_4d313a":"You're not suppose to be hanging around here, citizen. Move along.",		"s_496168b6":"I need your help...",		"s_42deb08e":"Wasting my time is not a smart idea...",		"s_11cdd7b1":"And it would be best, for your health, not to come back.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (victor_questn_capitol.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
