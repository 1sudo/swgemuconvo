And I think my hands are turning blue.",	"s_46":"You mother thinks you need to be convinced to stop smuggling.",	"s_47":"I don't need to be convinced. I need to be freed. I owe two of the smugglers money. Until I'm free from that debt, I can't leave.",	"s_48":"What if those two smugglers disappeared?",	"s_49":"Yeah, okay. That would pretty much do it. Their names are Oret Sturm and Jaryn Minoze. If you can get rid of them, I'll quit this and become an accountant like my dad.",	"s_50":"Thank you. I'll call my mom and let her know that I'm quitting the smuggling business."
