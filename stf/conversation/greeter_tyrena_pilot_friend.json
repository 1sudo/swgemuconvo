What fountain?",	"s_26a9fa7a":"Ulaire still thinks that fountain is on the way. If you ask me, though, it's not coming. The Empire has seen to that. I just know it. I don't know why they have it in for my friend, Ulaire, but I can feel it.",	"s_2b99f43":"What is he gonna do?",	"s_2d397ab5":"I think it's the only option. All I know is that I'm not going to abandon Ulaire.",	"s_41323ada":"That's rough. You're sure he didn't do it?",	"s_5b823594":"Absolutely! I know this man, and he would never do anything like that. There's no chance. I don't know why the Empire is setting him up like this, but if my friend says he's raising money for a fountain for the city, then that's what he's doing. There's no doubt in my mind.",	"s_729d1b46":"So what are you going to do?",	"s_8b392030":"That's an option, I suppose.",	"s_bd6f92c3":"Ulaire raised some money to purchase a fountain for that empty square over by the Agrilat Geyser. But the Empire is pressuring him and claiming that his fundraising efforts were a scam. They're saying that Ulaire is keeping the money for himself. Nothing could be further from the truth, of course, but I think the Empire has already made sure the fountain never arrives.",	"s_c81c50e7":"Well, between you and me, I'm trying to convince him that we should get off this planet. Maybe join with the Rebels, at least long enough to get far away from here. The Rebels aren't a bad lot. I'm not sure I really want to fight a war, but at least we could get away from here and maybe even strike back at the Empire."
