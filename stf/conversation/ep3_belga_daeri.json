Yes there is a pirate up there taking more than his fair share.",	"s_398":"Fair share?",	"s_400":"We do not have a lot of support from the Empire on this one, and the Trandoshans only care about their shipping lanes. Piracy is expected to be dealt with by the individuals traveling these space lanes. Normally, they don't cause too much trouble. But this one has become a problem. Not content with taking cargo, he has destroyed a number of transports in the last few weeks and shows no signs of stopping.",	"s_402":"So you want him brought in?",	"s_404":"Brought in? And where would I put him? No, just destroyed will suffice.",	"s_406":"Then destroyed it will be. Where can I find this Dorn?",	"s_408":"He operates in Kashyyyk space but does not reside here. If you take down some of his lackeys then eventually he will come looking for you.",	"s_410":"Do you have a lead?",	"s_412":"I will provide you with a transponder signal for his suspected cohorts. The rest is up to you.",	"s_414":"Be careful if you approach the river to the north, you might find yourself in a Wookiee and Trandoshan battle."
