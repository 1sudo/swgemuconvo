If you want to retire from being a Meatlump, you have to bring in at least one new person to take your place. But I don't know anyone.",	"s_13":"What if I took your place?",	"s_15":"Oh, really? That would be nice, I think. Then I could just sleep all day and watch holovids. Oh, but you'll need to speak with my lieutenant. Her name is Kaiya. She's usually somewhere around Coronet.",	"s_2":"",	"s_23":"Why are you doing that?",	"s_24":"I don't know. Why not? Kaiya likes it when I smash things. She's my lieutenant...Kaiya is. But I don't know why I do it any more. I think I'd like to stop.",	"s_28":"Ho hum. Smashing stuff is fun, I guess, but I think maybe I've had enough.",	"s_29":"Oh, don't mind me. I'm just smashing this machine thing.",	"s_4":"I think the first thing I'm going to do now that I'm retired is go find some seashells on the beach.",	"s_9":"Well then stop."
