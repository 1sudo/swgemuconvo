I just want the blaster he took back.    The blaster belonged to my father and he had no right to take it with him, the thing was an antique and didn't even work.  To tell you the truth, I would be more surprised if my brother was still alive.",	"s_1cf278e9":"I will help you find your brother.",	"s_1f8a26f8":"This means quite a lot to me. Thank you.",	"s_202dc610":"More the fool am I. I should have stopped him. Or something. Now he's gone and he took it with him.

And thanks for nothing.",	"s_5bdbb8de":"Where can I find him?",	"s_61":"Your charm has won me over, how can I help?",	"s_63":"Good.
