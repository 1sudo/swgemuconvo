That isn't the sort of tool that I give out to just anyone, but since you are working for Milo, I just might have what you need. Here, this is a Cypress Yunitronic...never mind...this is a tool that will bypass most security systems. Just use it on the terminal you wish to gain access to. Good luck to you.",	"s_14":"Sorry, my friend, but I am really busy. This computer terminal isn't going to fix itself. The access matrix is a complete mess and I am going to have to bypass our security system to fix it. Fortunately, I have one of my special tools that makes that job a snap.",	"s_2":"",	"s_4":"Hey, I heard you were doing some work for Milo. That is good because we need all the help we can get around here.",	"s_6":"I need to ask you for a favor.",	"s_8":"Sure. If it is within my power, I will certainly help you out."
