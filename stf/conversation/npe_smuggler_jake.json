What are you doing here?",	"s_15":"Han Solo thought you might have work for a good smuggler.",	"s_17":"I do. And you are a good smuggler, I guess. Maybe I can't afford you.",	"s_19":"Considering I'm stuck on this station, I think you can.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"I need to move a crate of sliced weapons off Station Gamma. It pays 500 credits. You interested?",	"s_23":"Let me buy you a Corellian Brandy and we can talk.",	"s_25":"I'll take you up on that. Another brandy over here, please! I need to move a specific cargo from Outpost Gamma. It's a crate of sliced weapons. It pays 500 credits. Interested?",	"s_26":"Sure. I could use the work.",	"s_27":"The weapons haven't been taken to the drop point. I left instructions in your journal. Please refer to it for instructions.",	"s_29":"Excellent work. You are all that your reputation says.

Good luck!",	"s_36":"Ah, I love Corellian Brandy! Here's to Corellia!"
