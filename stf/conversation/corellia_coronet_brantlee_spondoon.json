This informant wants one of us to meet with him in a warehouse where he will fill us in on the details. Go meet this informant and find out what he knows.",	"s_12":"I would be proud to do so.",	"s_14":"Very well. Go to the warehouse and see what this informant has to say. I do not expect any danger, as very few people know about this meeting, but be prepared for anything just in case.",	"s_16":"Not right now. Maybe another time.",	"s_18":"These things wait for no man, but I understand that timing can be important. Speak with me again if it suits you.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Greetings and welcome to the heart of the Corellian government. I'm afraid that the Diktat is a busy man and cannot chat, and if he's busy, then I am as well. We do appreciate that you've come by, though, and hope that you will return again soon.",	"s_4":"I must express my most profound thanks for your role in clearing this administration of the accusations that were being raised against us. You are a credit to us all.",	"s_6":"He was attacked by rogue CorSec? The fact that they actually were after this informant lends some credibility to whatever his story would have been. If only you'd gotten to that datadisk before they did. Thank you for trying.",	"s_8":"Go meet with the informant. I do not know how long he will wait, and he made it sound like there could be people after him. "
