So you don't know any racers? Not even swoop racers?",	"s_84":"Maybe. Talk to Draknus about running some test tracks. If you finish them we'll see about any droid motivators we might have lying around.",	"s_85":"I can do that. Tell me where he is.",	"s_86":"You can find him here.",	"s_87":"I can't find Draknus.",	"s_88":"You can find him here.",	"s_89":"I will go back and see if he needs anything else.",	"s_90":"Goodbye.",	"s_91":"We were discussing the location of a droid motivator?",	"s_92":"Ah, yes. You can find the wreck of his podracer here. I think you will find the motivator still in his ruined droid. Apparently, the programming he installed in the little droid didn't help him as much as he thought it would.",	"s_93":"Thank you. I will go collect the part, now.",	"s_94":"Be careful, Tuskens have been seen in that area.",	"s_95":"Maybe, anyone started podracing again?",	"s_96":"Only small groups, nothing organized yet.",	"s_97":"I see. Let me know if they do get organized.",	"s_98":"You will be the first one I tell."
