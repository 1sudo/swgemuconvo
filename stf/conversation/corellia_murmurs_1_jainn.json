A contact of mine mentioned that he was smug...er...shipping some rather odd items from a group that he couldn't name.",	"s_12":"Doesn't that kind of...shipping happen often?",	"s_14":"Yes. But he was visibly sweating, which is very odd. He's scared and in my experience, that's bad. Extremely bad. I've also lost track of him.",	"s_16":"I'll look for him. What can you tell me about him?",	"s_18":"His name is Moril. He's a Bothan who does some work for the traitorous CorSec troops.
