I bet they were surprised.",	"s_18":"You could say that.",	"s_19":"Well, as long as the other slaves made it out ok. I wish I could have helped you.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"You did. You gave me the correct information.",	"s_21":"Thank you for saying that. Here, I was able to access my account while you were gone. You earned this.",	"s_22":"Thanks again.  I found out almost all the slaves made it out safely. You did a great job.",	"s_24":"You must get that information. Please don't let me down.",	"s_26":"I tried to help as many of the other slaves as I could. When Kyran made his break I tried to cover for him, but the guards hit me when they were shooting at Kyran. I was unconcious, he must have carried me out of there.",	"s_28":"I'm sure you did all you could.",	"s_30":"No. I needed to do more. There is still more to do. You must do it for me. I can't with my wounds.",	"s_32":"I am going to the bunker. What is it you need me to do?",	"s_34":"Just shut the place down. I learned that there is a central computer room that helps the guards keep track of us all. It's supposed to have trideo records of everything that goes on in there. It should be enough to get CorSec involved if you bring it to the right authorities.",	"s_36":"Sure. I can do that. You should rest now. ",	"s_38":"Thank you.",	"s_40":"Talk to Kyran. He will tell you what we need."
