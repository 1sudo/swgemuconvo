Hopefully better this time.",	"s_2b40f4fd":"Excellent work, pilot. I'll transfer your extended mission pay now. The Cloak officer is on his way to the interrogation base now.

Find and eliminate the Cloak attack wings.",	"s_6c23a697":"You were right to come to us with this, pilot. It is good to see that your loyalty to CorSec is unwavering. However, this does present a unique opportunity to go undercover with the cloaks.",	"s_7023f204":"CorSec Command is impressed, pilot. That went off without a hitch. We will get to work tracking down how this information was leaked, and who leaked it. Here is your extended mission pay.",	"s_71a60205":"As you wish, %TU.  Please clear the area for other traffic.  CorSec station, out.",	"s_71e0fb8":"I am.

You've done a good job eliminating the Cloak sect in this system. Now the survivors have fled and are trying to regroup. We need you to get to the Dathomir system and eliminate the remnants.

Please identify yourself and state your business.",	"s_8bd9c726":"Do you have any special CorSec assignments for me?",	"s_8eddcaf7":"You have entered CorSec space in the Corellia System.  Please identify yourself.",	"s_9":"Understood. I would like to land.",	"s_903180db":"CorSec command will contact the freighter and have them hyperspace out as soon as the Cloak attack ships start to come in. We will send an attack squadron there to ambush them.",	"s_9288900f":"I understand.",	"s_942f251f":"As a matter of fact, we do have an elective duty assignment for you. Ever since we've uncovered this Cloak sect, small attack wings have been popping up everywhere. We need you to go out and destroy them. Will you accept this mission?",	"s_9624c26b":"Get out there and capture the Cloak officer. Hurry we don't have much time.",	"s_99824a76":"Roger, %TU.  For a fee of %DI credits we'll repair just enough to get you underway.  Please confirm.",	"s_9bd6e8c6":"This is top priority, pilot. Intelligence tells us that the leader of the Cloak sect will be passing through the sector very soon. We need you to intercept, disable, and upload your autopilot override program to his ship. Hopefully capturing this villain will squelch any further Cloak activity in this sector.",	"s_9be6fb53":"Received, %TU.  Half of your ship damage has been fixed.  You are clear to leave the area.  CorSec station, out.",	"s_a4e56782":"So you've decided to go undercover? You are to be commended. Not many pilots would be so brave. There's not much to do now but wait until the Cloaks contact you. In the meantime, here is your extended mission pay.",	"s_a5591c27":"I accept this mission.",	"s_a7a9ff1a":"I see. That is excellent. Now is the perfect time to strike. Here's what we'll do. Meet the freighter and offer an escort as expected. When the Cloaks come in, they will expect you to allow them to freely attack and board the freighter.",	"s_a827381c":"Good work, pilot. Here is your extended mission pay. We'll look into who these 'Cloak' pilots are and keep our eyes open for more activity. In the meantime, carry on with your standard operations.",	"s_a8b432b3":"Good. Taking out an entire Cloak attack wing should weaken their forces significantly. Of course then your cover will be blown, but that should be acceptable. Are you ready?",	"s_a98368fb":"As you wish, %TU.  Please leave the area to make room for incoming traffic.  Out.",	"s_ade7f893":"No, I will decline this mission.",	"s_ae89219d":"Acknowledged. Proceed to the Dathomir system and destroy the Cloak remnants.",	"s_af84143a":"Bye",	"s_b1525744":"Do it",	"s_b284b08f":"Very well. Carry on, pilot.",	"s_b596ece0":"Very well, %TU, you are cleared for landing at the Doaba Guerfel Starport.",	"s_b6a0e70f":"Request declined. I am in need of urgent repairs.",	"s_b84b366c":"How can I help?",	"s_bf0e6b55":"This is a very important operation, pilot. Don't screw it up this time.",	"s_bf5b2480":"Welcome to the Corellia system.  We cannot assist you at this range.  Fly closer and identify yourself.",	"s_c11eb75b":"Request declined. I must land immediately.",	"s_c3399297":"Coronet Starport.",	"s_c358d041":"(Request Repairs)",	"s_c3f09c65":"Roger that, %TU.  We can repair three-fourths of your ship's damage at a fee of %DI credits.  Are you ready to transfer the funds?",	"s_c804e280":"Very well, %TU, please clear the area for other traffic.",	"s_c84e1098":"You're treading thin ice here, pilot. Hopefully nothing will go wrong this time.",	"s_c9c08b99":"Let me try again.",	"s_ccc6f3ed":"Kor Vella Starport.",	"s_cd78560b":"Sorry, you cannot try again right now. Maybe later.",	"s_d00437d0":"Very well, %TU, you are cleared for landing at the Coronet Starport.",	"s_d066a27d":"The officer gave up a meeting location and a time. A courier is bringing leaked CorSec information to transfer to a Cloak ship at that location. We need you to destroy the Cloak ship and pick up the leaked information in its place. Are you up to it?",	"s_d44fd86f":"That's understandable. It could be extremely dangerous. In that case, just go to the location and destroy his ship. However, if you change your mind and decide to go undercover, dock with him and see what he has to say.",	"s_d6306870":"We've interrogated the Cloak Officer that you captured. It seems like this group is a splinter cell of the Hidden Daggers clan. We're still not sure what their intentions are, but it seems like they are targeting CorSec exclusively.",	"s_d8f24b5b":"Repair a little of the damage",	"s_db1a3377":"Good. The operation is about to begin. We'll assign you an operator and transmit the mission data now.",	"s_dfd4b5bb":"I am ready and willing.",	"s_e0234542":"Understood. I would like to land.",	"s_e2d1b03":"Something urgent just came up. A ranking officer of these 'Cloaks' has been seen passing through the system. We need to capture him for questioning. Do you think you can handle it?",	"s_ecb04612":"Good work, pilot. Under the circumstances things went as well as could be expected. Since the Cloak leader was destroyed, I don't think the remaining forces will be much of a threat. Here is your final extended mission pay.",	"s_edb238bc":"Go on.",	"s_eec4dc6e":"Very well, %TU, you are cleared for landing at the Kor Vella Starport.",	"s_ef7f535a":"A complete repair of your ship will cost %DI credits, %TU.  Are you sure?",	"s_f0f7d52d":"Very well, %TU, you are cleared for landing at the Tyrena Starport.",	"s_f6948278":"Coronet Starport (Freelance Pilot Trainer).",	"s_f7203392":"Assigning you an operator. Transmitting data now."
