This isn't mine ... wait those are my seals on the spice containers. You could have only gotten this by killing them all. ",	"s_13":"Now enough foolish posturing. You will do everything that Osea wants, or pay the price. Understand?",	"s_139":"",	"s_141":"So what can I get for you? You need a quick snack? The fried crystal snake is a great mid-day meal.

I told that little Hutt wannabe that I wasn't interested in playing petty informer for her. I have my own very profitable operation.",	"s_147":"Not any more. Here's the proof.",	"s_15":"You and Osae have ruined me. Every credit I had was tied up in that spice shipment. Ok tell her that I will start passing on information to her. ",	"s_9":"You!!!
