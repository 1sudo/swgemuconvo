What brings you to our humble facility?",	"s_15":"Just looking around. What is this place?",	"s_16":"Have you managed to convince Nurfa to return to the negotiations?",	"s_17":"Not yet.",	"s_18":"I really hope you can get him to return soon.",	"s_19":"I managed to convince him to return to the talks with you.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"That is most excellent news. Hopefully, we can hammer out a deal that both parties will be satisfied with. Please accept this as a token of the company's appreciation for what you have done. Thank you, my friend.",	"s_22":"This is mining facility AG3-T of the Mensix Mining Company. Our world is rich with many resources that are considered to be desirable in numerous systems throughout the galaxy. We Mustafarians have made a very comfortable living supplying those systems.",	"s_24":"For a mining facility, it doesn't seem to be very busy.",	"s_26":"A very astute observation. It is true we are having a bit of a labor crisis. A group of our miners have gone on strike and we are having a great deal of difficulty getting them to at least talk with us.",	"s_28":"Is there anything I can do?",	"s_30":"Maybe there is. The striking miners refuse to talk with anyone involved with the company, but maybe they will talk to a third party. If you could convince the miners to return to the talks, that would be most helpful.",	"s_32":"I will try to convince them to talk with you again.",	"s_34":"That is most kind of you. You will need to speak with Nurfa Laz'op. He is heading up the group of miners. They have a camp not too far from here. Do your best to convince them to return to the negotiations with us. We need those miners to get back to work, but we also wish to do right by them. Thank you again.",	"s_36":"Nah, I don't think I should get involved in a labor dispute.",	"s_38":"That is too bad. Well, I hope you enjoy your stay on our world.",	"s_4":"It is good to see you are still doing well.",	"s_6":"How did your talks with Nurfa go?"
