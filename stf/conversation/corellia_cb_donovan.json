Cora sent me.",	"s_8":"I do not know where I am.  I was at another camp after they hijacked my ship.  Then they moved me here.  They have me shackled so I cannot escape.  I think Vinros has the key, and there is the underboss outside and lots of henchman.  Something will have to be done.  Contact Cora. She will know what to do to get me out of here."
