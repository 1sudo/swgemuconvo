I say, you look somewhat familiar...did we perhaps meet near Ord Mantell? On board Tansarii Point Station? Regardless, I wonder if I might convince you to lend us some assistance?",	"s_37":"Well done! These will do nicely. ",	"s_40":"How can I help?",	"s_41":"So much has been said about the resilience of helper droids that we decided to see for ourselves. They never deviate from their assigned tasks. We believe it has something to do with their interface units. Please find us some of these interface units so that we can analyze them further.",	"s_42":"You're on your own, droids.",	"s_43":"Ah, I see. Perhaps it's for the best then. Good day to you.",	"s_44":"I simply cannot wait another minute. We must be going soon, R2. Those helper droids, quite frankly, send a shiver down my circuits.",	"s_6":"Have you had any luck finding some helper droid interface units?"
