Our historian said you'd be arriving. Unfortunately our uplink node is undergoing repairs, so I can't transmit the data right now.",	"s_310":"These disks have important information on Jedi history.

We were deceived for so long.",	"s_316":"I agree. Thankfully the Emperor was able to see them for their true colors. His courage is why I became a Soldier for the Empire.
