Want to earn some credits?",	"s_38":"Are you a prisoner?",	"s_40":"I was. Are you going to research my background or help the camp out?",	"s_42":"You said credits? For what?",	"s_44":"Yeah?",	"s_45":"Need anything done?",	"s_46":"Look, you look a little green to be around her in my opinion. Come back when you have more experience.",	"s_47":"You come back and help some time soon. All full right now.",	"s_50":"Look, you don't do what I say, you don't get credits.
