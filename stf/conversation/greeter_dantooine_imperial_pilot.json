An AT-ST remains firmly on the ground, though. That's the important thing. Don't you see? Two feet solidly on the ground. That's my goal.",	"s_9bd0d381":"Oh, hello. I'm kind of busy right now. Not as busy as Col. Rabor would like me to be, obviously, but I still feel busy nonetheless.",	"s_af081ce":"Oh, but I am. I'm trying to convince my flight officer, Col. Rabor here, that I shouldn't be a pilot. Not a space pilot, anyway. I'm not good with all the space and the emptiness and the being way, way up in the sky. It's fine for some, I guess, but I'd rather stay connected to the ground. I'm thinking that driving an AT-ST would be more my style.",	"s_c71e3ca9":"You don't look busy.",	"s_fbaa9d84":"Those AT-STs are pretty tall. You'd still be pretty high off the ground."
