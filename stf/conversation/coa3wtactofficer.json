There's a waypoint in your datapad for another warehouse we've found. Go get it!",	"s_1b5eac32":"Good! Jabba has warehouses of that flora all over the Galaxy. As we find them, we are sending volunteers out to destroy them and confiscate the flora. I've added a waypoint to your datapad for a warehouse we've located close by. Go destroy it and confiscate any flora you find. I'll reward you for any Alderaanian Flora that you turn in.",	"s_1b8e1fa4":"I've got some business I need to take care of first.",	"s_1cb2157b":"I'm ready to take out another warehouse",	"s_1f281089":"That's what I like to hear. There's a waypoint in your datapad for another warehouse we've found. Go get it!",	"s_268282e6":"Hmm, that's odd. Maybe we already took care of that one. Here, I've given you a waypoint for another warehouse we need taken out. Good luck to you!",	"s_29fae614":"Alright, come back any time you feel like helping me find more of these stores of Alderaanian Flora.",	"s_2e791c9d":"I can't complete this mission.",	"s_31":"Hmm, that's odd. Maybe we already took care of that one. Here, I've given you a waypoint for another warehouse we need taken out. Good luck to you!",	"s_33":"I can't complete this mission.",	"s_38f00205":"Quit standing around then and move it.",	"s_3c57b03":"Why haven't you destroyed that warehouse? Is something the matter?",	"s_3d82703f":"Well I appreciate the offer of help anyway. If you want to try it again later, come back and let me know.",	"s_5166bfb2":"I'm not interested in that right now.",	"s_688721b0":"Sorry, I'll get right now it.",	"s_6a582260":"Are you a moisture farmer or something? I guess we all can't be soldiers. Well I appreciate the offer of help anyway. If you want to try it again later, come back and let me know.",	"s_743c9f18":"You still haven't destroyed that warehouse. Why is that?",	"s_83258fb0":"What? Don't have the stomach for it? Come back when you've had a chance to settle your nerves.",	"s_885ae409":"Ok, suit yourself then. Come back any time you feel like helping find more stores of Alderaanian Flora.",	"s_8d1b9304":"I wasn't able to find the warehouse.",	"s_acadf21d":"If you haven't completed the Coordinator's tasks, you should return to him. If you have, we know of more warehouses you can assault anytime. Either way, you can hand me any Alderaanian Flora you have and I will happily reward you for it.",	"s_b8e8976a":"You're the one the Coordinator sent to help out? I see. Well, if you're here you must be doing something right. Right now our biggest issue is getting a hold of this Alderaanian Flora. Without it Dead Eye is just so much space garbage. We need people to go out and strike at these underworld storehouses and recover as much as we can.",	"s_ba1a3080":"Nothing's wrong, never mind.",	"s_ddef5a7b":"There's plenty more warehouses to take care of if you're still interested! Otherwise, maybe the coordinator has something else he needs done. Either way if you have any Alderaanian Flora you'd like to dispose of, I will happily reward you for it.",	"s_e40779f7":"Well quit standing around! There's work to be done!",	"s_e4daff30":"I'm not going to be able to help you right now.",	"s_f2fe6350":"I was not able to find the warehouse.",	"s_f64d217f":"I'm sorry I can't talk right now. I'm very busy. This Dead Eye situation is getting out of control and I have my hands full. Rather than chit-chatting, how about you lend a hand already? Go and talk to the coordinator and make yourself useful.",	"s_f96e5eed":"I'd be happy to help."
