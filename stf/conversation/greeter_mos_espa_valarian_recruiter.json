Jabba will get you killed, and probably at the hand of one of our pilots. Lady Valarian may not have quite the reach of Jabba, yet, but she's much more generous and can provide a much better ship. Most of the blood stains have already been removed. And if you can pay off the ship, it's yours. Free and clear. Just remember who you work for because that won't change."
