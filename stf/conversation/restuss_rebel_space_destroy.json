We're in your debt. We have reports that there's still more TIEs scheduled to be transferred from the Yavin system though so if you're up to it, let me know and I'll assign you another mission.",	"s_2":"",	"s_25":"Good to see another soldier joining the fray. We sure could use you. If you're a pilot, I need your assistance with taking control of the Corellia system. The Imperial Navy is planning to bring in capital ships for ground bombardment, to help in their defense of Restuss. We can't let that happen. I need you to destroy 30 of their military ships so that we can maintain control above Rori.",	"s_27":"I will do my best, sir!",	"s_28":"Good to see another soldier joining the fray. We sure could use you. If you're a pilot, I need your assistance. Since we've maintained control of the Corellia system, the Imperial Navy is making one last push. They are bringing in fighters from other parts of the galaxy for a massive fleet attack. Your mission, if you accept, will be to destroy 15 TIEs in the Yavin system.",	"s_30":"I will do my best, sir!",	"s_31":"I know you will, pilot. Good luck up there, we're counting on you!",	"s_32":"I know you will, pilot. Good luck up there, we're counting on you!",	"s_33":"Good to see another soldier joining the fray. We sure could use you.

You should check with one of the other officers here and see if they have something you can assist them with.",	"s_37":"I'm afraid I'm not a pilot, sir.",	"s_38":"I will do my best, sir!",	"s_40":"I know you will, pilot. Good luck up there, we're counting on you!",	"s_41":"Sorry, but I cannot take the risk that you might be an Imperial spy. I can only hire pilots who do not work closely with the Empire.",	"s_42":"I'm afraid I'm not a pilot, sir.",	"s_43":"I understand.

This place is about to get very dangerous for civilians.",	"s_49":"The Empire has no place here.",	"s_6":"Splendid work, pilot. We're in your debt. There's still more of the Imperial Navy up there though. If you're up to it, let me know and I'll assign you a new mission."
