Maybe I'd better do something else then.",		"s_ef01f5ee":"Yes, but I'm afraid you don't have the even the most basic skills needed to help out. Perhaps you should see if someone else needs assistance.",		"s_e25e215d":"No, I can't help you.",		"s_e0c642e":"Excellent! The binary load lifter droid QT-QC has the schematics you'll need for the project. You'll also give it the ingredients you make. You can check the status of the defenses and how well you're contributing to the project at any time. May the Force be with you!",		"s_da07ca0e":"Thanks for helping out with the defenses. You can still supply more ingredients if you'd like.",		"s_cf89ace1":"Yes, we need people to help create defenses for the village. You'll need to contribute at least %DI ingredients to the project. If you do, it will help you gain insight into how the Force can be used to improve your crafting technique. We're also giving awards to whoever brings the most or best ingredients. Are you interested?",		"s_ca02afa6":"Refined Rudic",		"s_c57c793":"I'd like to know about the amount of ingredients people are giving.",		"s_c1dac897":"How may I help you?",		"s_bc2ccc0e":"There is no crafting project currently being run. Please come back later.",		"s_baf57f52":"I'd like to get the status of the village defenses.",		"s_a9474f4a":"Ok. You should know that if you help out with the defenses, you won't be able to do any other work here in the village until later. Is that ok?",		"s_a489b2f6":"The overall project.",		"s_a1a54741":"I was, but I've got plenty of people helping me at the moment. Perhaps you should see if someone else needs assistance.",		"s_99347a8f":"Yes, I'd like to help out.",		"s_955b2ddb":"I hear you're looking for crafters.",		"s_87a5e151":"Refined Ardanium II",		"s_6f1f7b10":"I'm sorry you can't help out.
