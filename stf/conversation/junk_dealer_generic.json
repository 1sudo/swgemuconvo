I mean they had to go somewhere, although my guess is that they are probably all over the galaxy by now.",	"s_14efaaa2":"Ok, here you go. I guess in order to make it work you need to add ten special components to the kit. When you examine a kit, it has a list of what you need in order to complete the kit. It also has a read-out of whether it currently has a component or not. Oh, and if you do happen to make anything useful with that kit, I might be interested in buying that from you.",	"s_27":"Ok, here you go.

Maybe you should clear out some room and talk to me again if you are still interested.",	"s_32":"Ok, here you go. I guess in order to make it work you need to add ten special components to the kit.

Maybe you should clear out some room and talk to me again if you are still interested.",	"s_3633b5a5":"Can't say that I blame you for not taking one. It's sad that I can't even give them away. If I ever see that inventor again I am going to make him really sorry.",	"s_37":"Ok, here you go. I guess in order to make it work you need to add ten special components to the kit.

I know I really want to get rid of all these kits but I just can't be handing them all out at once. You never know when they might be worth something.",	"s_3fc7eb45":"Well let's see here. I have one that makes an orange rug, one that makes a blue rug, one that can make a Nabooian sculpture, one that makes a table, and one that makes some sort of model gong. I will only give you one kit at a time so if you want another you are going to have to get rid of the one you currently have first.",	"s_42":"Ok, here you go.

Can I buy it back?",	"s_44":"Of course! All you need to do is give me back the credits. What was the item?",	"s_47":"Looks like your inventory is full. Come back when you make some room.",	"s_48":"How can I mark items so you know what to buy and not to buy?",	"s_49":"I am sorry but you do not have any space in your inventory for me to give you a kit. Maybe you should clear out some room and talk to me again if you are still interested.",	"s_4bd9d15e":"That is too bad. Remember to come visit me in the future if you happen to come across anything I would be interested in.",	"s_4d65752":"I just want them gone. They are taking up valuable space in my inventory so I will just give you one of each type if you want.",	"s_50":"Just select an item in this list to toggle the items sellable or no sell.",	"s_54fab04f":"I have some things that you might be interested in.",	"s_5b10c0b9":"I am sorry but you do not have any space in your inventory for me to give you a kit.

I am a buyer of goods that most would deem as junk. If you are interested I will look through what you have to offer and set a price for anything that I wish to buy. I also have come across some other items of interest that I am looking to get rid of.",	"s_cd7a3f41":"I am sorry but I don't think I have anything you would want.",	"s_d347bee3":"Ok sounds good. What sort of kits do you have?",	"s_d9e6b751":"An inventor recently sold me and my fellow junk dealers a large quantity of these special kits that were supposed to revolutionize crafting. Unfortunately, they are useless without the special components that they are designed to use.",	"s_e1a103e5":"Hmmmm, well how much do you want for these kits?",	"s_e29f48dc":"Apparently this inventor had them all on a shipment that was coming in from the core worlds. As luck would have it the shipment was hijacked en route and all the components were lost to pirates. This caused the inventor to go out of business, leaving all of us stuck with these useless kits.",	"s_ee977dee":"Let me have one of those orange rug kits.",	"s_fe657cdd":"I think I would like one of those model gong kits."
