And you tell that chef... well, tell him his pie was really good. And that I'll try and pay for the next one.",	"s_35494a44":"Hey... who are you? What are you doing following me? At least you're not that crazed chef. He was out of his mind. I mean, it was just a pie.",	"s_78cca73a":"What? No! Ha. That's truly unbelievable. Okay, so you're here. Now what? You gonna try and collect some money for that pie?",	"s_7ca121b2":"Oh man, that pie was so good. I hope that guy makes another one. I might even pay for the next one.",	"s_867ceb54":"Whoa! Hold it. Just a minute. For a pie? You want blood? Alright. Whatever. Come on. Let's go!",	"s_928c6a6a":"The chef wants revenge. But I think I've made a mistake.
