Very good. My business associates thank you for keeping their trade safe. Here is your payment.",	"s_28":"I'd love to do nothing more than chat, but I'm busy.",	"s_29":"Ah. You look like the kind of person that can help me.",	"s_30":"Sgt. Snopel sent me to you.",	"s_31":"Take care of that base. I won't pay you until the job is done.

A bunch of sand pirates are interfering with my business partners.",	"s_33":"How are they interfering?",	"s_34":"Any transport that gets within a thousand meters of their base tends to have some unfortunate accidents...at the end of blaster bolts.",	"s_35":"So what am I to do?",	"s_36":"Simple.
