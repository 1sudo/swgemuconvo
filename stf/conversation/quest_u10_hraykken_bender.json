My brother, Draykken, is set to assault a droid factory, but needs some troops to do the actual work...er, I mean to help out. I'm sending you.",	"s_29":"Oh, okay. I can do that.",	"s_30":"No, I don't have time right now.",	"s_31":"Good, good. Um...I guess you should get going then. Those droids won't destroy themselves. Believe me...we've been waiting and hoping, but it never works.",	"s_32":"Ah, I see. Sure thing then. I'm sure someone else will come along eventually. It's not like those droids are going anywhere while we wait.",	"s_5":"Destroying droids is one of my favorite things to do. Or to be more precise, sending other people out to destroy droids."
