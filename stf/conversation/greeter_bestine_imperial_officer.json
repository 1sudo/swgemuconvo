		"s_fd5402d8":"Ah! Then it should give you information about where to go to start your naval adventure. Good luck, my friend!",		"s_fb096a5a":"Well, giving them out may not be the phrase I'd use, but I guess it's not far off the mark. The Empire will supply new pilots with a ship. We're pretty well-equipped after all, and one can't exactly be an Imperial pilot without a ship. I've also heard rumors that the Alliance has prepared a fleet of ships so that they can get new recruits into the fray as soon as possible as well, but I can assure you that I only care about that if they come to Bestine.",		"s_f5f72ae1":"My pleasure. Anything else?",		"s_f3ec92a":"Use the planetary map to travel to the vendors listed on it, but not all vendors will be listed there. For the unlisted ones, you'll have to travel around looking for player-owned buildings that hold vendors. Once you've found a vendor, double-click it to see what it has for sale. You can also check bazaar terminals, but the listings on those will only be low-end starships and ship components, if even that.",		"s_f2a4df5e":"Good idea! Thanks.",		"s_efbaf135":"You're obviously not involved with the business of space flight, so I really don't have time for you. Good day.",		"s_e843e3ab":"Use the command CTRL+V to open the planetary map. On the right side of your display, you will see a listing of trainers by category. All local trainers who register with the planet will appear on this list. Click the 'Trainer' tab and then look for a pilot trainer.",		"s_e1c13ebb":"Double-click on the envelope icon, and read your mail! Anything else?",		"s_e013f498":"Look for the flashing 'envelope' icon on your interface. It's placed on the lower right-hand side of your screen by default.",		"s_df7992b9":"There are some freelance pilots here and there, though the Empire mostly frowns upon that kind of activity. At the same time, we do recognize that there is a need for a small number of freelance pilots to handle certain jobs with which the Empire does not want to be associated or simply views as beneath our notice. As I understand it, most freelance pilots are recruited through email.",		"s_d4c6e8cd":"No problem! Anything else?",		"s_cf5fc0f":"How do I repair my starship?",		"s_cc7c9754":"Don't mention it. Anything else?",		"s_cb747ceb":"Hmm. Me neither. Maybe you should give it a little time?",		"s_ca776e30":"Who are you?",		"s_c9e97ed5":"How else would I join up?",		"s_c4682ea6":"Thanks!",		"s_ba95f774":"Bazaar terminals are located all over major cities. Check the areas surrounding major hot spots like the starport, the bank, any of the cantinas, or even the hospitals.",		"s_b9b27823":"Thank you.",		"s_b641cda6":"Where can I find a bazaar terminal?",		"s_b42842dd":"What kind of business are you and your friend doing?",		"s_add31f19":"I need a starship.",		"s_acc368b1":"How do I join the Empire?",		"s_abc6d2f6":"Your best bet is to get in touch with the Empire and sign up for their training program. There are others who will urge you to put your efforts to use in the Alliance, but fools will be fools.",		"s_a9850aec":"I got an email from the Alliance!",		"s_a054d9fc":"Good luck, my friend! Anything else?",		"s_98e32091":"Well, then could I ask some other questions?",		"s_9721ce96":"Money. Right. I know that some people have fallen on hard economic times because of the war. Many pilots are flying for either the Empire or the Rebellion these days in order to get off the ground. Ever think of joining the military as a way to get a starship?",		"s_8e84f7eb":"You did? From the Alliance? And you're telling me this? Look, it would be best for all concerned if you just ignored that email message, and we both pretended this conversation never took place.

 Anything else I can actually help with?",		"s_8cf9be64":"Where can I find a vendor?",		"s_8b37a99a":"How do I make money?",		"s_8b23fac":"I want to learn to fly.",		"s_89a5ddb":"Always willing to spread me wisdom. Just as long as it doesn't get spread too thin.",		"s_8515e448":"Yes. I have an email from the Imperial Navy.",		"s_8337797f":"Excuse me pilot. Er, you are a pilot, yes? You see, the thing that confuses me is the lack of an Imperial uniform, because as I'm sure you know, only Imperial pilots are allowed to fly from my starport here. Well, maybe just this once I'll pretend I didn't see you. All that paperworks is rather bothersome. But do try and stay out of trouble on my watch. Very good.",		"s_7b064e95":"Don't mention it! Anything else?",		"s_72f5c999":"I think that the majority of pilot trainers are registered with the planetary map. Try opening the planetary map with CTRL+V. On the right-hand side there is a listing of categories. Look under 'trainer' to find any local pilot teacher who's looking for pupils.",		"s_726e332f":"There are all sorts of civilian contracts available on the 'mission terminals' you find throughout town. Look for them near any major structure. Use the terminal to bring up the current list of local contracts. Choose the one that interests you the most, and you'll make money when the task is complete.",		"s_68cb68ff":"Is there anyone else I could fly for?",		"s_5ff8baab":"I was wondering if you could answer some questions?",		"s_5e410744":"Right-click on the map location to create and activate a waypoint. Follow the waypoint to the trainer's location.",		"s_5c80b75a":"You're welcome. Did I actually help? Well, that wasn't so hard. Anything else?",		"s_594bfcf2":"Good advice, thanks.",		"s_5618d2cd":"No. I have received no email.",		"s_558a361a":"The Imperial Navy? I've heard that they are sending out recruitment emails to everyone they can locate these days. Have you checked your email today?",		"s_52939a0":"How do I check my email?",		"s_50129856":"Oh good, an Imperial Starship Pilot. Just follow normal procedures and always log your arrival and departure times with the officer on duty. I think I assigned an officer to be on duty. Well, log those times either way. Dismissed.",		"s_495777c0":"Have you checked any vendors? Merchants use vendors to help sell their merchandise. Shipwrights put finished starships and ship components for sale on their vendors, and then you can go to those vendors and purchase what you need.",		"s_4918186c":"Well, I suppose that is my job, more or less. So yes, how may I be of assistance?",		"s_472f61d1":"Local space stations are the easiest way to get your ship repaired. When you are heading back here, you should stop at the space station and ask them for repairs. They will provide a quick estimate on what it will take to get you back on track.",		"s_41594520":"Right. So how do I check the planetary map?",		"s_4126da47":"I'm offering a small fortune worth of travel vouchers in an effort to pay off. Wait, why am I telling you this?? Let me just add, though, that double or nothing is not as good as it sounds.",		"s_3ab7e5b8":"Ah, my apologies. I am the officer in charge of this starport. All incoming and outgoing space travel is authorized by me. Or not authorized in some cases.",		"s_3700bf66":"I'd be willing to bet that you're a pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You should probably take this opportunity to vanish before I decide whether or not to place that bet.",		"s_32146025":"Then what?",		"s_30efbb57":"Do you really think you should be asking me that? Even if I did know that some Alliance pilots are bold enough to register their locations on the planetary map, I wouldn't exactly be telling people. I'm an officer in the Imperial Navy, after all.",		"s_3059f369":"What then?",		"s_27186cee":"I don't have enough money.",		"s_270c87b2":"How do I get them to repair my ship?",		"s_21bf1a8c":"How do I join the Alliance?",		"s_186acb93":"Yes, hello. Welcome to the township of Bestine. Sandy jewel in the Imperial crown, as I'm sure you'll find. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have business with my associate here.",		"s_17bc5d9b":"When you approach the space station, use SHIFT+C to target it and open communication with the commander. You will be asked if you want to purchase repairs or if you want to land on the planet.",		"s_144ec5cc":"Sounds good. Thanks!",		"s_12157feb":"The military gives out free ships?",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (greeter_bestine_imperial_officer.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
