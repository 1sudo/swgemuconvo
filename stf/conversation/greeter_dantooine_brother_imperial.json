But he joined up with the Rebel Alliance while I became an Imperial pilot. I mean, now we're on opposite sides. This wasn't supposed to happen.",	"s_713ef70":"Isn't Fern a girl's name?",	"s_8092cf42":"It's not that easy. I get the feeling that the Empire doesn't look kindly upon those who leave. And my training officer is big and mean. I don't think I could handle telling her I want out.",	"s_a68463ed":"That's a very good question! One I've yet to get a good answer for. Yeah, why should I be the one to quit? Let Kess quit. I hope he does, because I really don't want to fly against him.",	"s_b19f6c96":"What!? No!! I can't...
