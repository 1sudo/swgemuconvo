You'll have to look for it.",	"s_23":"Have you found the medicine?",	"s_24":"Yes, I have it right here.",	"s_25":"Good, give it to me. I want to make sure the guards haven't done anything to it.",	"s_26":"Here you go. It's just as I found it.",	"s_27":"The seal is unbroken. This is the new package he came in with. Excellent work, friend.",	"s_28":"You're welcome.",	"s_29":"Finish what you need to do here, I will get the medicine back to Vermon.",	"s_30":"Go see Vermon when you are done here.",	"s_31":"You've done a good thing here, friend. I came back to make sure everyone can get out ok.",	"s_32":"What's going on here? You're not supposed to be here.",	"s_34":"I was sent to find you by a man named Vermon.",	"s_36":"Vermon? Is he ok? Did Kyran get him out?",	"s_38":"Why are you concerned?",	"s_40":"Vermon has been through a lot. He's a good guy as long as he gets his medicine. I don't think Kyran had time to get it before they made their escape.",	"s_42":"Medicine? Vermon is sick?",	"s_44":"Yes. He's mentally ill. He's ok as long as he takes his medication.",	"s_46":"That explains a lot. Do you have his medication?",	"s_48":"No. I suppose you could check the slavers' medical computer and find out if the guards still have it.",	"s_50":"Do you know where this computer is?",	"s_52":"I would guess in the sick bay, but I have no idea where that is.",	"s_54":"Ok, I will look for it.",	"s_56":"Come back if you find his medicine.",	"s_58":"Might want to be a bit more stealthy, friend. The guards around here will make a slave out of you."
