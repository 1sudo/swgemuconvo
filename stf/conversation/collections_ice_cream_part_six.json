Who is asking?",	"s_12":"I just wanted to ask you about this fryer.",	"s_14":"Let me see that contraption.  Yeah...I used to put these together in a factory.  That was a long time ago.  How did you get this?",	"s_16":"I found it.  Can you help me reverse engineer it?",	"s_18":"Well.  Not really.  The only thing I ever worked on was the ventilation system.

That is basically all I know.  Here.  It's this unit right here.",	"s_24":"Anyone else at the factory with you that might know more?",	"s_25":"As a matter of fact yes.
