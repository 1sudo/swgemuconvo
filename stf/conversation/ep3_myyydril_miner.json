What are you doing here?",	"s_502":"I'm just looking around. What is this place? What are those?",	"s_504":"Oh, you mean these? [The miner motions to the blue crystals.] They are Nak'tra Crystals and this is one of our Crystal Gardens. We miners extract the crystals for our weaponsmiths. They can make weapons out of them. It's all very interesting if you like that sort of thing.",	"s_506":"Where do I get Nak'tra Crystal weapons?",	"s_508":"Hm. Well, we have been experiencing a shortage of personnel lately. The whole Urnsor'is thing.. [The miner waves it off.] Speak with Treesh. He's grumpy and only speaks with weaponsmiths. But, I'm sure you have a weaponsmith friend, right?",	"s_510":"Well, it was nice talking with you. Back to exploring.",	"s_512":"[The miner nods, returning to his work.]",	"s_672":"Rrwworr!"
