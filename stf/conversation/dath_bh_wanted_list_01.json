I don't ever want to see your face again!",	"s_1508f5fc":"Well, my friend... you'll find all three of them hiding here in the Dathomir system under the watchful eyes of Elite Mercenaries. They've spared no expense!",	"s_159911f5":"Tell me more.",	"s_1a71ed59":"How much?",	"s_1e2e55e8":"No, not like you. Juree La'Zar is a killer of innocents. A savage. Not like you. Certainly not like me, either!",	"s_21ef58ea":"Elite Mercenaries?",	"s_234c808f":"Empire pays 1000 credits... and I throw in a bonus of 200 if you do it quickly. What do you think about that?",	"s_265d5a02":"Where is he now?",	"s_2ad07084":"Rae'Lux flies a modified Y-wing that he stole from a small Rebel base in the Outer Rim. He's rumored to use experimental ion-sheet armor. Supposed to be super lightweight, but still really tough!",	"s_2cafb575":"Before you leave for good... come back by. I'll have something extra for you.",	"s_2e64927c":"Your final target is Juree La'Zar, who was once a beautiful and gifted bounty hunter... driven insane after being horribly disfigured while captive to the Black Sun.",	"s_315f7d8":"Alright, I'm interested.",	"s_34efde77":"She and her gang crippled an Imperial bacta freighter on the edge of the Dathomir system. Left the crew alive, made off with some components. After the rescue team got the freighter to the Imperial base and unloaded the bacta... they found that Juree's gang had poisoned the whole supply. Killed hundreds.",	"s_3552cf48":"I don't think there's many lowlifes out there who could take you one-on-one, %NU. Maybe you'd find three villains more challenging?",	"s_37778692":"A hunter like me?",	"s_3a71c840":"You betrayed me! Now get out of here, %NU!",	"s_3aeefc74":"How will I recognize him?",	"s_412a3b40":"So tell me then... what do you know about the 'Avenger of Alderaan?'",	"s_42a7f468":"Well if it isn't the famous %TU... bounty hunter extraordinaire! What can I do for you today?",	"s_43d9d825":"You failed that mission? Terrible! Here it is again... for a price.",	"s_44ca831b":"Where will I find him?",	"s_47efee53":"(Pay 500 credits)",	"s_4c695dbd":"No.",	"s_4f7b0318":"Good... then there's just the small matter of payment...",	"s_4fb7a65d":"He's been lurking around the Dathomir system for a while now. The Empire thinks he may have acquired hired some low-rent mercenaries for protection.",	"s_52917b0d":"Of course.",	"s_53fb1d89":"Nobody needs to know the truth.",	"s_5e49253":"That's good news, I guess. You know, word is getting around that you are responsible for all of my recent success... and it's starting to make me look bad!",	"s_6a1562ad":"What do you want?",	"s_6bd02793":"Nothing.",	"s_6bef416f":"The Bwar Brothers are history.",	"s_6c03db3":"Nothing. I was just leaving.",	"s_782c3536":"See you later.",	"s_785a9a91":"I'm sure they won't be any threat to you, %NU.",	"s_7e1ada01":"Yeah, yeah...",	"s_89b2deb1":"What are you still doing around here?",	"s_90ae19e2":"Well this 'Avenger' managed to work his way onto the Empire's most wanted list. They'll pay handsomely if you hunt him down... enough to make you forget about having to pay my 500 credit fee. What do you say?",	"s_92ccbd55":"Get on with it.",	"s_94e8b49c":"Good. I like parting friends. It's much simpler, you know?",	"s_958f6d7d":"I give you all the info you'll need to track down and vaporize this degenerate killer. What do you say?",	"s_9bd0f533":"Good. Stay gone, Bounty Hunter!",	"s_9c098d52":"You have failed the mission? Here it is again... for a price.",	"s_9caba7d5":"It's not wise for you to linger here in Dathomir system, my friend.",	"s_a0102a9":"We can get started for the low, low price of 500 credits.",	"s_a019416c":"Rae'Lux was no match for me.",	"s_a0277a4c":"How will I know him?",	"s_a351fef0":"Too late, %NU. The damage is done. Now, I want you out of here. It's only fair that I offer you one final mission, with good payout... before you go away for good. Do you think we can make a deal?",	"s_a366b511":"So. Tell me...",	"s_a560e84c":"I am looking for work.",	"s_a6425c9":"I think we can arrange something. There are three or four fresh bounties on the Imperial 'net. For the right price, I can give you exclusive rights to the contracts. Are you interested?",	"s_a6519855":"Good work, %NU. You were good for business. Here's an extra thousand to get you on your way.",	"s_a80d9308":"Good luck!",	"s_aa66418e":"So you made it, huh?",	"s_af58f306":"Word on the street... Rae'Lux likes to hide in the Witchblood nebula. They tell me he leaps out of the clouds every now and again to rob deep space transports that are flying solo.",	"s_b5a05d56":"Perhaps you have heard of the Bwar Brothers from Tatooine? An infamous trio of kidnappers who terrorized the Outer Rim for years before Jabba's henchmen ran them off. Guess they were bad for business...",	"s_ba82c312":"And you promise to leave once you've eliminated the target and gotten your reward?",	"s_c0917a4d":"Good. Keep leaving...",	"s_ca932c28":"Forget it.",	"s_d030521":"Bah, leave me be!",	"s_d1a93a0e":"What's the reward?",	"s_d424c740":"I was just leaving.",	"s_d70dba34":"Yes.",	"s_dc649bb3":"I'm on my way!",	"s_e42b260e":"I'm on my way.",	"s_e6772f13":"Goodbye.",	"s_ecaf7e94":"So, your target is a vile killer named Gutcher Gorai. He was convicted of twenty counts before they finally caught him on Coruscant. Too bad for the Empire he got away. Good for you though, huh?",	"s_edddcc46":"What does 500 credits get me?",	"s_f0b711b4":"Gutcher Gorai favors a Hutt-style chassis that has been heavily modified with illegal equipment. Some say his weapon system is overcharged with some sort of distressed codellium capacitor.",	"s_f1bd52fe":"Then we have nothing more to say to each other. You're dead to me, %NU. Dead. So vanish... like dead people vanish...",	"s_f8a99129":"(Pay the 500 credits)",	"s_fafc5a4e":"Good luck, Bounty Hunter.",	"s_fb42a64c":"Still alive, huh?",	"s_fc70ad30":"So you're looking for a pilot calling himself Rae'Lux... convicted of detonating over a dozen civilian transports in the Naboo system. Thinks he can find refuge here on Dathomir. You'll show him otherwise, eh?",	"s_fe02e665":"What did she do wrong?",	"s_ff607592":"What's it to you?"
