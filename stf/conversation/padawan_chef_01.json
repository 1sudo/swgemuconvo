Ah sweet and glorious day!",		"s_e15ebf39":"It's not fair. Not at all. I hate everyone.",		"s_d70dba34":"Yes.",		"s_d5ab69d1":"Okay. Don't waste too much time I don't know how long until he discovers that tracking device.",		"s_be6b7d06":"Problem solved? Did I get my revenge?",		"s_bc5c7c4a":"Not just yet. I'm still working on it.",		"s_b654720c":"I chased the thug all the way to the edge of town. He ran off into the wilderness, and I quickly lost sight of him. But I managed to at least tag him with a small burst tracking device, so I know where you can find the bum.

Destroy him.",		"s_a7c3aea6":"Who took what?",		"s_9bf6042f":"But?!! No!!!!

I want my revenge! I must have it! My precious vengeance! Who are you to stand in my way.

Well, drat.",		"s_9bcbdc35":"Good for him.",		"s_959fc17d":"Some random thug came by here, and took my latest creation.  

It was a fantastic pie, and I won't be able to make another of its grandeur for quite some time.  I put my heart and soul into that pie.",		"s_94e89675":"That is one sad story.",		"s_8cddb8eb":"Arrrgh. You... you're just cruel. Taking pleasure in another's misfortune.",		"s_8a0862a1":"It sure is.

The pie is long gone, I can feel it in my blood.  What I want is revenge.  Revenge is the only thing that will taste as sweet as my precious lost pie.

Are you willing to help?",		"s_7c9388b6":"Yes. He died screaming like a newborn bantha and begging for his life.",		"s_7c44e561":"What?? I can't... ah no,  my sweet revenge!??!",		"s_78228c87":"You are right, I'm sorry.  Who took what?",		"s_58e01006":"He took it.",		"s_56b146aa":"Now, that was uncalled for.",		"s_53e26aec":"No. I didn't hurt him. I'll not exact your petty revenge.",		"s_4c695dbd":"No.",		"s_3f4dfda1":"No but I'm done. I'm not going to help you seek revenge.",		"s_39d844c":"Is it over? Has that thug paid the price I asked?",		"s_32e459b5":"It's gone... all gone.",		"s_236213e1":"So? Tell me what happened. Did he die painfully?",		"s_1ba9c89d":"I don't care, I'm glad he took it.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (padawan_chef_01.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
