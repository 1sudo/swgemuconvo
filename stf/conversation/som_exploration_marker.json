It is good to see you are in good health. Are you back to check on some more markers for me?",	"s_15":"Welcome to our fiery moon. I have noticed you around and was hoping for a chance to speak with you. You seem very interested in helping others and I was wondering if you would be willing to perform a small task for me?",	"s_17":"Sure. What is it you need?",	"s_19":"Well, I have put up a number of markers around the planet. They are very helpful to keep track of certain important areas. Our world has a tendency to shift unexpectedly and it is important that we carefully mark different areas. Naturally, the markers also shift, so we occasionally have to manually check them out to make sure they are still valid.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"Naturally. So what is it I can do for you?",	"s_23":"Well, recent events have left me extremely short-handed, and I was hoping that you would check out these markers for me. The job is really simple. All you need to do is find the markers and activate them to make sure they still have valid information on them.",	"s_25":"That seems easy enough.",	"s_27":"It would be, except that due to the shifting of our moon's surface, I cannot give you precise locations. All I can do is give you general directions to where each one should be. Each of Mustafar's main areas has several of these markers scattered throughout them. I will need you to activate each area's markers individually.",	"s_29":"What would this sort of job pay?",	"s_31":"Hmmmm... How about this? For each area you complete, I will pay you five thousand credits. And as a bonus, if you check all the markers in all the areas, I will give you a Tanray Heart Crystal.",	"s_33":"What is a Tanray Heart Crystal?",	"s_35":"It is a fabulous crystal formed under intense heat and pressure that is...well, it is shaped like the heart of a tanray. They can be worth a hefty sum to certain collectors, but most people just use them as decoration. So do we have a deal?",	"s_37":"Okay, we have a deal.",	"s_38":"Yeah, I will check a few more areas for you.",	"s_39":"No thanks. Maybe later.",	"s_4":"Ah, it is my good friend again. I hope everything is going well for you. Unfortunately, I cannot chat today. My boss has asked me to pull a double shift and I really need to get back to work. Take care.",	"s_40":"That is most excellent news. Same deal as before, five thousand credits per area completed and if you complete them all, I will give you a Tanray Heart Crystal. Which area would you like to search for markers in?",	"s_41":"Thank you.",	"s_42":"A deal is a deal. Safe travels to you, my friend.",	"s_44":"Excellent. So what area would you like to search for markers in? We have markers near the mining facility, in the Crystal Flats, up in the Smoking Forest, around the Central Volcano, in the Burning Plains, all over Berken's Flow, and, of course, in the Tulrus Nesting Grounds.",	"s_46":"Do you have any markers around this facility?",	"s_48":"Sure do. Remember, you will receive five thousand credits per area searched, and if you complete them all, I will toss in a Tanray Heart Crystal.",	"s_50":"How about in the Crystal Flats?",	"s_52":"Of course. Remember, you will receive five thousand credits per area searched, and if you complete them all, I will toss in a Tanray Heart Crystal.",	"s_54":"I would like to search the Smoking Forest.",	"s_56":"That is a good choice. Remember, you will receive five thousand credits per area searched and if you complete them all, I will toss in a Tanray Heart Crystal.",	"s_58":"Perhaps I could search the Central Volcano.",	"s_6":"Hello again, my friend. You certainly have done a wonderful job and saved me all sorts of trouble trying to check all of those markers out. And as promised, here is your Tanray Heart Crystal. Thank you again.",	"s_60":"Always a nice decision. Remember, you will receive five thousand credits per area searched and if you complete them all, I will toss in a Tanray Heart Crystal.",	"s_62":"What about searching the Burning Plains?",	"s_64":"I hear it is nice this time of year...well as nice as Mustafar gets, anyways. Remember, you will receive five thousand credits per area searched, and if you complete them all, I will toss in a Tanray Heart Crystal.",	"s_66":"I will search the area called Berken's Flow.",	"s_68":"Ah, Berken's Flow...I learned how to mine there. Remember, you will receive five thousand credits per area searched, and if you complete them all, I will toss in a Tanray Heart Crystal.",	"s_70":"The Tulrus Nesting Grounds is a good spot.",	"s_72":"A very fine valley. Remember, you will receive five thousand credits per area searched, and if you complete them all, I will toss in a Tanray Heart Crystal.",	"s_74":"No thanks. I think I will pass on this job.",	"s_76":"Not right now. Maybe later.",	"s_78":"Of course. I wouldn't want to impose on you too much."
