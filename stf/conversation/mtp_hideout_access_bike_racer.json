They left it behind...probably forgotten in their lustful rampage of destruction. There was also a map to their camp. I will upload the coordinates for you.",	"s_28":"Riding a speeder bike is the only thing I know how to do and I gotta do something.",	"s_29":"They smashed my bikes. Some Meatlumps. I know of them on Corellia, but had never run into any here on Talus before this.",	"s_4":"I hope you make them pay...the foul, degenerate miscreants. Talus was much better off without Meatlumps, and I, for one, look forward to the day in which they are once again gone from this planet."
