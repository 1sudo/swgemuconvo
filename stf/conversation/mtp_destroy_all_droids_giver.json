The lower maintenance areas are full of droids. Can you go destroy some of them? I'd do it myself, but...um...oh, I have a bad knee. Yeah, that's it.",	"s_13":"Okay.",	"s_15":"Oh good. You'll have to be fast though. After a while, security droids will notice all the noise and investigate. You'll only have about ten minutes once you're down there.",	"s_17":"No thanks.",	"s_19":"Oh, couldn't get them all in time? I'm not surprised. None of us could do it either.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"You knee starting to go bad as well?",	"s_4":"You got rid of all those droids? What a relief! Thank you!!",	"s_7":"Go get rid of those droids. The lower levels are full of them. They give me the creeps...being so close to us.",	"s_9":"It's not yet safe to go back and get rid of more droids. It might attract too much attention."
