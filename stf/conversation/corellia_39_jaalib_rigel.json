There's usually a guard directly above us. Keep your voice low. Okay, if you're here to help me, than I'm grateful. Otherwise, be on your way and let me figure out my next move.",	"s_44":"I'll help you.",	"s_45":"You're on your own.",	"s_46":"Okay, that's great. These people, these Chirq Council or whatever they call themselves, are experimenting with some new heavy weapon prototypes. You seen what the ones we already have can do, right? Spew lava all over the place. Or acid. Things like that. Not exactly environmentally friendly. So I aim to stop these people from making even worse versions. Go destroy their heavy weapon prototypes.",	"s_47":"That's the way I like it. Get's too messy otherwise.",	"s_48":"Very nicely done. I'll stay and make sure that they don't try to rebuild those weapons, but your part is done for now. I'll let you know if I need more assistance.",	"s_49":"They are experimenting with some new heavy weapon prototypes. I aim to stop them. Go destroy their heavy weapon prototypes. According to my sources, there are three prototypes."
