I have a proposition for you. During this Festival that celebrates Love and Romance, there are those who lack someone with whom to share their life. You can help change that. Are you interested?",	"s_14":"I would be glad to help.",	"s_16":"Of course you would! I could tell from the first moment I saw you. Very well, I will assign you a companion. Your job is, quite simply, to find them someone who matches them in the hope that true love will spark.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"Thank you.",	"s_22":"No, thank you. The galaxy has a bit more love in it thanks to you. And please come back tomorrow. I'm sure I can find someone else for you to match by then!",	"s_23":"I'm ready to go.",	"s_24":"Wasting no time...I like that.",	"s_25":"How will I do that?",	"s_26":"Throughout Tyrena on Corellia and Kaadara on Naboo, there are potential matches for your companion. These people are also looking for love and have come to us for assistance. Speak with your companion and learn what kind of things he or she is looking for, then speak with those potential soul-mates until you find one that matches. Nothing could be easier!",	"s_28":"okay, I'm ready to go.",	"s_30":"Then let's get started!",	"s_32":"No thanks.",	"s_34":"Oh, I see. Happy Festival of Love to you.",	"s_4":"You have made this a Festival of love to remember for those two lucky people! Well done.",	"s_8":"Get to it. These people won't find a soul-mate on their own. Believe me, they've tried."
