I wouldn't be surprised if the corporation will resort to violence against us strikers soon.",	"s_139":"I don't like your look. You should move along...",	"s_140":"How may I assist?",	"s_171":"Yes, we are still here and will be until this is solved.",	"s_173":"This looks like a mine but you aren't working?",	"s_175":"What is going on here?",	"s_177":"No, we are currently on strike.",	"s_179":"How come?",	"s_181":"Alright. Well good luck then.",	"s_183":"Thank you. We need it.",	"s_185":"Recently we found out that one of the executives in our corporation is skimming bonus money that should be going to us, the workers. The corporation doesn't take our allegations seriously, though, so we're not working.",	"s_187":"You don't say? Do you have any proof?",	"s_188":"Interesting. Well, good luck with that.",	"s_190":"Thank you. We need it.",	"s_191":"Hmm, why do you ask?",	"s_192":"Well, I was sent here by that executive to sabotage.",	"s_193":"Oh, I'm just curious.",	"s_194":"Well, these days, we can't be careful enough, so I believe our conversation ends here.",	"s_195":"Well, I was sent here by that executive to sabotage.",	"s_196":"I understand.",	"s_197":"Good. You take care now.",	"s_198":"I knew it! I was wondering how long it would take him to resort to that kind of action. How come you are telling me?",	"s_199":"After hearing your side, I'd like to help you guys out.",	"s_2":"",	"s_200":"Interesting. You asked earlier if we have proof and we indeed do. The problem is that the executive's men will probably attack us on sight if we go near the headquarters. You, on the other hand, could go in freely.",	"s_201":"Agreed. What do you need me to do in there?",	"s_202":"If we give you a disk with the proof we have, you can upload it onto the corporation's communication network. Then they can't ignore us anymore.",	"s_203":"Sounds easy enough. I'll do it!",	"s_204":"Good, here's the disk. You will find the computer terminal inside the main mining facility.",	"s_205":"Very well, I will return when it's done.",	"s_206":"I look forward to it. Be careful of guards on the executive's payroll. They will try to stop you if they figure out what you are up to.",	"s_207":"The executive will get suspicious, friend. You should go to the mining facility and upload that data as soon as possible.",	"s_208":"My friend! We have already heard the good news! I believe the corporation is setting up the trial for that scum, as we speak, and I've received word that they are sending a negotiator out here to come to an agreement. We couldn't thank you enough.",	"s_209":"It felt good sticking it to that pompous vermin.",	"s_210":"I agree! Now we are by no means rich, but we all chipped in and have managed to put together a credit reward. We also have this hologram for you to remember us by.",	"s_211":"I'm most grateful. Thank your men for me.",	"s_212":"We're the ones that are grateful, friend. Take good care of yourself!",	"s_214":"Not much.",	"s_216":"I can see that. How come?",	"s_261":"We are on strike.",	"s_262":"Why?",	"s_264":"Recently we found out that one of the executives in our corporation is skimming bonus money that should be going to us, the workers. The corporation doesn't take our allegations seriously, though, so we're not working.",	"s_266":"You don't say? Do you have any proof?",	"s_268":"Hmm, why do you ask?",	"s_270":"Well, I was sent here by that executive to sabotage.",	"s_272":"I knew it! I was wondering how long it would take him to resort to that kind of action. How come you are telling me?",	"s_274":"That guy deserves to be taught a lesson.",	"s_276":"Interesting. You asked earlier if we have proof and we indeed do. The problem is that the executive's men will probably attack us on sight if we go near the headquarters. You, on the other hand, could go in freely.",	"s_278":"Most likely. Why?",	"s_280":"If we give you a disk with the proof we have, you can upload it onto the corporation's communication network. Then they can't ignore us anymore.",	"s_282":"Shouldn't be a problem.",	"s_284":"Good, here's the disk. You will find the computer terminal inside the main mining facility.",	"s_286":"Very well, I will return when it's done.",	"s_288":"I look forward to it.

You take care now.",	"s_300":"Interesting. Well, good luck with that.",	"s_302":"Thank you. We need it."
