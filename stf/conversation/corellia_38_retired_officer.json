I am ready to confess. Do not misunderstand, I am not happy to have been caught. There is no weight of guilt lifted from my shoulders. But I shall face justice with whatever dignity I have left.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"You found my medal? I am very happy. Where was it?",	"s_22":"It was next to Kal Braggan's dead body.",	"s_25":"Oh my. I don't think this will be good news after all.",	"s_32":"Have you found my medal yet?",	"s_34":"Yes, may I help you? Are you here about my stolen medal?",	"s_36":"Yes, that's right. Can you tell me what happened?",	"s_38":"Well, I do not know what happened. My Corellian Medal of Honor is gone. That is all I know. I had expected you to tell me what happened.",	"s_43":"Where ever could that blasted thing have gotten off to? I simply cannot find it.",	"s_44":"I'll do what I can. When did you last see your medal?",	"s_45":"Oh, I cannot recall. You should talk to my aide, Edbr. He might know when I last wore it. I cannot keep these things straight any more.",	"s_46":"That's right. Want to tell me what happened?",	"s_47":"Kal Braggan contacted me. He said he had proof of what I had done. So I went to speak to him. As a gentleman. I really had not meant to hurt him. Just scare him off. But things got out of hand, and I panicked. I must have dropped my medal during the chaos that ensued. Oh my. It would seem that this medal is my undoing. How appropriate."
