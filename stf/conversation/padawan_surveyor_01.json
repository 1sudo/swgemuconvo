		"s_f78dd868":"Speaking of fast, watch how quickly I tell you I'm not doing it.",		"s_f547f53":"Great, I hope it wasn't too difficult.

Thanks again.",		"s_e01d4e3a":"I can't believe you think I am INTERESTED.",		"s_df1f4d74":"Sure, I'm willing to help you out.",		"s_cc8d7500":"Back so soon? Wow, I'm impressed.",		"s_bed3977c":"Not so fast... I'm not actually finished yet. Give me a bit more time.",		"s_a9fb608b":"Oh thank you so much. I'm terribly afraid of large animals. Whew. That's a relief.",		"s_95cc5c27":"I can't believe he expects me to gather resources for him THERE.",		"s_88563437":"Doesn't much matter to me, either way it looks like it's not getting done.",		"s_80783f21":"Who?  What?  When and where?",		"s_723b6d0e":"Have you cleared the area? Is that sharnaff bull gone?",		"s_6f9237a3":"Yeah, right. Like that's gonna happen.",		"s_63bacc6c":"I'm not going. No chance. I'll simply get a new job. A much worse job, I'm sure. But at least I'll be alive.",		"s_4f0a7816":"Good questions.

My boss employs me to go out and gather samples for him from around the galaxy.  He recently asked me to go out and gather some from a fairly dangerous area. I mean, there's a sharnaff bull there. Those things are HUGE.

Actually, maybe you could help me.",		"s_2f57a101":"But... but. Fine. Maybe I can get work scooping sludge out of ditches.",		"s_29df11d8":"Not a problem. Just let me know when it's safe.",		"s_268abe":"I can't much blame you; I'd rather not as well.",		"s_1a4fb5a7":"Excellent, here is the waypoint my boss gave me.  

Once you've gotten rid of the sharnaff bull, come back and let me know so I can go do my thing.

Thanks! I really appreciate this.",		"s_14d76798":"Yes. It's safe there now.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (padawan_surveyor_01.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
