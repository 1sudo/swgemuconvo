Try selling it to the local junk dealer.  I bet you'll get a decent price.",	"s_12":"Actually, I was hoping to fix it.",	"s_14":"I doubt that would be the best way to approach getting a working fryer.  Take my advice and reverse engineer it and have a new one crafted.",	"s_16":"Any idea how I might do that?",	"s_18":"Sure.  I see you have much of the broken fryer intact.  All you have to do is get a bit of detailed information for all the pieces and store it in your datapad.  Once you have enough data you can create a schematic and give it to a trader to craft.",	"s_19":"Hmmmm. Which piece should I start with?",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"See those tongs in there?  Those are the fryer tongs and are used to lift food out of the fryer.  You are basically looking at a piece of bent metal with a handle.  Pretty simple.",	"s_22":"Oh.  I see.  But what about the other pieces?",	"s_24":"You might want to speak with Mikfa Faaus for other parts.  I will give you his current location.  I am much too busy to help you any further.",	"s_26":"I'm sorry but I am busy right now. If you can place your order with the order droid I will get to you as soon as possible.",	"s_4":"I'm sorry but I am busy right now. Place your order with the order droid.",	"s_9":"Oh.  Are you off soon? I was sent here by Hunde Decan...it is regarding this fryer."
