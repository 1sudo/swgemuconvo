		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (hx_138.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor.",	"s_101":"Bring this one back, just like the last one, %TU.",	"s_103":"Hmmm....what happened?  Do you need to redo the quest?",	"s_104":"Yes!",	"s_105":"Okay...lets fix this.",	"s_109":"Looks like you lost the datapad information with the shuttle waypoints. Let me give that to you again.",	"s_110":"Looks like you have all the parts. Give them to the mechanic and come back...there is something else that has come up.",	"s_113":"I've already noticed a boost in morale as a result of your efforts, %TU. You are certainly our saviour.",	"s_119":"We obviously can't save everyone. %TU, but we have to try. If you aren't the person for these missions please speak up. ",	"s_121":"I can do it. Give me another chance.",	"s_122":"I'm no one special.",	"s_123":"Mmmm...okay. Well, obviously you have your own mission. What is it exactly?",	"s_125":"There is another survivor at that same location. Don't mess this one up!",	"s_127":"Another success. That survivor may live into old age because of you. Great work.",	"s_129":"We're done?",	"s_131":"No. Another survivor is a little further out. Are you ready to attempt a rescue?",	"s_133":"I am ready.",	"s_135":"Find that survivor, %TU.",	"s_138":"I need to infiltrate the research facility.",	"s_139":"Yeah right. Ha ha...seriously now.",	"s_140":"Uh, I need to infiltrate the research facility?",	"s_141":"What? You were serious? Look, I can't ask these guys to help you. We've lost too many as it is.",	"s_142":"I don't need your men. All I need is a way to get in.",	"s_143":"That is suicide, but hey, you have made it this far.",	"s_144":"I gather the facility is sealed?",	"s_145":"No, but I hear it is very large and hard to navigate. The best way to find out where everything is down there is to get an administrative access key. You will have to talk to the Inquisitor about this, I was always responsible for duties topside.",	"s_146":"I see. Well it's been a pleasure.",	"s_147":"The pleasure was all mine, %TU.",	"s_157":"You've managed to save one survivor so I know you aren't completely incompetent. Stay alert! We have another survivor at that same location so you have a second chance.",	"s_159":"I'm ready.",	"s_161":"Go be the hero we need.",	"s_163":"Great work bringing the survivor back. We have a few more to rescue. Are you ready for the next location?",	"s_165":"I am.",	"s_167":"Here is the second survivor",	"s_174":"Fantastic work, %TU! Come back when you have gotten some rest. I can help you with your mission.",	"s_177":"GOD MODE ONLY INQUISITOR QUEST TESTING",	"s_178":"You are doing the Imp quest line, which Inquisitor quest would you like?",	"s_179":"You are doing the Reb quest line, which Inquisitor quest would you like?",	"s_180":"You are doing the Neut quest line, which Inquisitor quest would you like?",	"s_181":"Imperial Officer Body",	"s_182":"Imperial Scientist Body",	"s_183":"Imperial Stormtrooper Body",	"s_184":"Imperial Scout Trooper Body",	"s_185":"Imperial Inquisitor Body",	"s_186":"Done.

If this quest wasn't received, make sure you haven't already received or completed it.",	"s_214":"Look, I'm sure you feel horrible so I'll spare you any additional guilt. Luckily, another survivor at that same location contacted us so you have a second chance.",	"s_216":"I'm ready.",	"s_218":"Bring back the survivor alive this time!",	"s_220":"Where is the survivor?  There is no time for resting. Find that survivor and bring him back alive!",	"s_226":"Are you ready to get to work? Alright. We have a situation. There are survivors spread out topside and I need someone to go and lead them back. The others are too weakened by the lack of supplies but you look fit to carry on the task. What do you say?",	"s_242":"Another of the living! Tell me you came here by shuttle.",	"s_244":"No. Shuttles are not allowed into the quarantine zone.",	"s_245":"Looks like you took a break. Hope you are ready to get started on the rescuing the last survivor.",	"s_246":"Looks like you took a break. Hope you are ready to get started on the rescuing the next survivor.",	"s_247":"Looks like you took a break. Hope you are ready to get started on the rescuing a survivor.",	"s_249":"As I suspected. How did you get here? Oh that isn't important. Go get some rest and when you are ready, come back. I need a volunteer.",	"s_251":"Good luck with that mission of yours. We'll wait as long as we can for you, but don't expect us to wait too long.",	"s_253":"I ordered the shuttle to take off half an hour ago but they insisted on waiting for you. Get on that shuttle hero!",	"s_255":"Looks like you took a break. Are you ready to go get those shuttle parts?",	"s_257":"Hello there...deliver that radio to Sogan Varga. He'll be able to put it to use.",	"s_258":"I don't know who you are but you can stay with us. We'll get you out of here sooner or later.",	"s_305":"If I agree will you help me with my mission?",	"s_307":"Sure. We'll have time after you do a few tasks to find out exactly what that entails. Are you ready for the first location?",	"s_308":"Yes",	"s_309":"Here is the first location.",	"s_310":"(Godmode) I want to test the 4 different rescue 1 quests.",	"s_311":"Make sure you don't already have the quest, then select a choice below.",	"s_312":"outbreak_quest_rescue_01a",	"s_313":"outbreak_quest_rescue_01b",	"s_314":"outbreak_quest_rescue_01c",	"s_315":"outbreak_quest_rescue_01d",	"s_316":"Done",	"s_317":"Done",	"s_318":"Done",	"s_319":"Done",	"s_320":"(Godmode) I want to test the 4 different rescue 2 quests.",	"s_321":"Make sure you don't already have the quest, then select a choice below.",	"s_325":"outbreak_quest_rescue_02a",	"s_326":"Done",	"s_334":"outbreak_quest_rescue_02b",	"s_336":"Done",	"s_338":"outbreak_quest_rescue_02c",	"s_340":"Done",	"s_342":"outbreak_quest_rescue_02d",	"s_344":"Done",	"s_345":"(Godmode) I want to test the 4 different rescue 3 quests.",	"s_346":"Make sure you don't already have the quest, then select a choice below.",	"s_347":"outbreak_quest_rescue_03a",	"s_348":"Done",	"s_349":"outbreak_quest_rescue_03b",	"s_350":"outbreak_quest_rescue_03c",	"s_351":"outbreak_quest_rescue_03d",	"s_352":"Done",	"s_353":"Done",	"s_354":"Done",	"s_356":"(Godmode) I want to test the 4 different rescue 4 quests.",	"s_357":"Make sure you don't already have the quest, then select a choice below.",	"s_358":"outbreak_quest_rescue_04a",	"s_359":"outbreak_quest_rescue_04b",	"s_360":"outbreak_quest_rescue_04c",	"s_361":"outbreak_quest_rescue_04d",	"s_362":"Done",	"s_363":"Done",	"s_364":"Done",	"s_365":"Done",	"s_56":"Come back when you have the shuttle parts.",	"s_61":"You did it again, %TU.

While we were trying to rewire the spinal trunk we managed to blow the computer core memory.  ",	"s_71":"Uh...wow. Anything else?",	"s_73":"Yeah, we need a few power converters.",	"s_75":"How will I find all of these?",	"s_77":"The onboard computer has located several downed shuttles within the area. Go to those locations and search the wreckage for the parts. ",	"s_79":"Give me the coordinates.",	"s_81":"Uploaded to your datapad. Good luck. We are all relying on you.",	"s_83":"Yet another death. These survivors are depending on you, %TU! Luckily another survivor at that same location contacted us. Don't think, just do.",	"s_85":"Ok...okay, I'm ready.",	"s_87":"Bring him home, %TU!",	"s_89":"The Emperor will hear about you and all your fine work here, %TU. You are a true hero.",	"s_91":"Great. Tell him I miss Alderaan.",	"s_93":"You can channel your rebellious anger into rescuing the next survivor, %TU.",	"s_95":"Consider it channeled.",	"s_97":"Bring this one back, just like the last one, %TU.",	"s_99":"I exist to serve."
