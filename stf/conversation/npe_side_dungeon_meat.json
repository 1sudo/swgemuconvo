I need more samples of meat.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Oh, good. Another candidate. I need someone to go get something for me.",	"s_26":"You're back! Good, I can't wait to get started on this.",	"s_27":"That's going to be one crazy stew, you know.",	"s_28":"I know, but my job is on the line. Here, take these.",	"s_29":"Thanks.",	"s_30":"Maybe I can send you more money if Jabba likes the stew. If not, he's liable to feed me to his rancor.",	"s_32":"What do you need, and why can't you get it yourself?",	"s_34":"Too dangerous for me. You see, I am a chef, and I am trying to make a new meat stew. I plan to serve it to Jabba the Hutt himself. What I need is a new kind of meat...meat that you can't get anywhere else.",	"s_36":"You want me to collect some meat from whatever I find in there?",	"s_38":"Yes, but only a sample for now. We need to determine if it is even edible yet. Will you help me?",	"s_40":"Yes, I think I can help.",	"s_41":"You can't possibly help me right now.",	"s_42":"Thank you! Please return with a sample of some meat.",	"s_44":"No. That is disgusting, and I want nothing to do with it.",	"s_46":"Call it what you will...those Hutts will eat anything.",	"s_48":"What do you mean, another candidate?",	"s_50":"What? Oh, nothing. It's just that I sent someone else in there, and they haven't come back yet. You shouldn't have anything to worry about, though.",	"s_52":"Sure I don't...",	"s_54":"You see, I'm a chef, and I'm trying to make a new meat stew. I plan on serving it to Jabba the Hutt himself. What I need is a new kind of meat...meat that you can't get anywhere else.",	"s_56":"I already paid you all you're going to get. Go away."
