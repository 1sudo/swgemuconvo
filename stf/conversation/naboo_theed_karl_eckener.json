I overheard them talking, so I know that you'll need 3 codes to release me. Get the codes and use them in the prisoner constraint console over there. Add me to the access list so that I can use the console to free myself.",	"s_19":"Now that you have the codes, use the prisoner constraint console on the gate to override the security access on the cell controls.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"How do I get the codes?",	"s_21":"The Darkwalker leaders have them. Solon Gaw, Critolus Masse, and Marcus Gaw. You'll have to, um, take the codes from them.",	"s_23":"I'll be back when I have the codes.",	"s_24":"Yes, but they still did not release you.",	"s_27":"Good luck. And thank you.",	"s_34":"Help me. Please.",	"s_36":"The Darkwalker leaders have the codes. Solon Gaw, Critolus Masse, and Marcus Gaw. They will not give up the codes without a fight. When you have them, use the prisoner constraint console and add me to the access list for the console.",	"s_37":"Thank you for freeing me. I can find my own way home.",	"s_38":"Who are you? Can you help me?",	"s_39":"Your father sent me to rescue you.",	"s_40":"My father? Didn't he do what they asked?",	"s_73":"I'm free! I almost cannot believe it. Thank you! Thank you very much!",	"s_74":"I can escort you out of here.",	"s_75":"That's not necessary. Now that I have access to the prisoner constraint console, I can deactivate the cell bars and make my own way out, but thank you. Please let my father know that I'm free. Tell him I'll be there soon, if not before you."
