No, wait, what should I do now?",	"s_12":"Don't make such a fuss. Tell Sabe I'm fine. She'll understand. She'll believe you too. This is exactly the kind of thing I do when I get bored. Trust me. It's all for the best.",	"s_14":"I'm not sure who you are, but perhaps you should get out of here. This place is dangerous, in case you hadn't noticed.",	"s_2":"",	"s_4":"You've come to rescue me? That's very nice of you, and tell my sisters I appreciate it, but I really didn't want to be rescued.",	"s_6":"You didn't?",	"s_8":"No. The Maulers are a particularly troublesome group of thugs on Naboo, and I'd like to learn more about them. I've let them kidnap me so I can see firsthand what they do. I can escape any time I want really, but again, I do appreciate your stopping by."
