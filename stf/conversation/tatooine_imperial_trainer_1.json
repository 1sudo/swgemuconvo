Yes, it does mean you will have a new commanding officer. I'll skip the formality. You are now a Pilot Officer. Personally, I think it's a mistake, but Naval Command likes the results you've shown.",	"s_150":"Indeed.

Now stand at attention!",	"s_1a5d8b73":"Don't underestimate him. A particularly skilled and charismatic leader might explain the increase in the pirate activity.

Saving that transport was very uncharacteristic of you.",	"s_284":"Wing Epsilon Zeta, operating out of the garrisoned ISD Accuser, usually handles supply security operations.

Your job will be to fly a standard patrol sweep through the region.",	"s_2844cc74":"By Imperial Decree EMAL-1425A all special program pilots must be members of the Imperial Military prior to sign-up.

Got it?",	"s_28586fd5":"Very well.",	"s_2879b9e3":"Indeed.  You didn't seem the type.

You're a known Rebel pilot! Guards, arrest this man!",	"s_2d5d4bf0":"I'm interested in a duty.",	"s_2e935a2c":"Good to see you again, pilot. I hope your new assignment is going well. The voluntary conscription program has been quite successful. If there is anything I can help you with, let me know. Although you are overqualified, I can offer you some basic missions and duties. I can also train you in simple skills, in case you need a refresher.",	"s_2f923a47":"Yes, you're probably right about that. You managed to help secure valuable medical supplies. A lot of people owe you for your bravery.",	"s_2fe328e":"By the powers vested in me by the Imperial Naval Command, under the ever watchful eye of the Emperor, I hereby conscript you to service with the non-officer flight rank of Pilot Initiate.

Now, deliver your report on the Commerce Route patrol.",	"s_31967d85":"Does this mean I get a new handler? I'm sick of working with you.",	"s_323e4b0d":"I will decide when you are ready for training, Pilot.  And right now I say you aren't.  Now, about your new role in the Outer Rim security detail...",	"s_346":"Thank you, sir.",	"s_34975e9f":"Report back to me when you've successfully completed the mission.",	"s_34bc5f5e":"You don't have the experience to apply to training.",	"s_34ff44c5":"Maybe you should reread your flight manual. Come back when you want to try again.",	"s_350":"Pirates? Tatooine is known for criminal activity, but Bestine has always been strongly protected by Imperial justice.

Please wear it while you are on duty.",	"s_378987b0":"Let me know if you decide you want to work with us.",	"s_37910d75":"With the recent increase in pirate activity, our supply transports are at risk.

You will be paid for every successful escort operation you complete.",	"s_37979335":"Report back to me when you are finished with the patrol.",	"s_37ae364a":"That overconfidence will get you killed some day. We have Intelligence reports on areas of high pirate activity that will be good places for you to start your search for the pirates. Report back to me upon completion of your task.",	"s_37eb1d12":"I'd rather not sign up right now, sir.",	"s_387":"As it stands, I do have an assignment for you. As you know, ships travel to and from Bestine every day along the Primary Commerce Route. Commercial traffic to Bestine is limited to the route, so we can scan each ship for illegal cargo. I want you to perform a circuit patrol of the Bestine PCR.",	"s_388cfea9":"The Empire is recruiting volunteer pilots?",	"s_391":"(Give a mocking salute.)",	"s_3988f447":"We are the greatest fleet in the galaxy, surmounting even the warships of the old Republic.

Come back when you're ready for your 'job.'",	"s_3b1fee95":"Report to me when you are ready to give it another try.",	"s_3b3aabc1":"I'd like training, sir.",	"s_3b510c1a":"The purpose of this patrol assignment isn't to add any additional security to the Commerce Route. I highly doubt you would be effective in a combat situation. This is to assess your ability to pilot a ship and follow basic instructions. I've transferred the patrol route to your datapad. You are to fly to each point in the patrol route and then report back to me upon completion. Is this clear, Pilot Initiate?",	"s_3ca32099":"They're as good as dead.",	"s_3d5b4720":"Why would the Imperial Navy need to...outsource?",	"s_3de840b5":"I need to spend some time practicing.",	"s_3f6a8711":"Thank you, sir. I do my best.",	"s_3f904297":"Lost it? How do you lose one of those massive things? Alright, I'll imprint you a new one, but don't lose it. They only give me a limited allotment of these disks every week.",	"s_402":"What about training?",	"s_416":"Thank you, sir.",	"s_420":"Thank you, sir.",	"s_422":"Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_424":"I'd rather not sign up right now, sir.",	"s_42b12aab":"Perhaps they merely find them surprising coming from you. Here's your payment as well as a bonus for saving the transport. I also received your Imperial flight suit, but you're much too large to fit into this... take this bandolier instead.  At the very least, it will help you organize your things.",	"s_42be2dbc":"Tighten it up, pilot! If you fly half as bad as you smell, you'll end up space scrap. Discipline is key to victory.",	"s_42bfca2f":"If you've got work that pays, I'll listen.",	"s_42dfe6db":"Indeed. The Empire rarely enlists non-Humans as pilots, and so we are poorly prepared to equip someone such as yourself. But do not be discouraged. Your current standing in the Imperial Navy is a testament to your abilities.",	"s_431ac3d4":"Very good.

Shape up or you'll find yourself in a detention block.",	"s_46c8d76c":"Show respect, Pilot! Outside you might be street scum, but in this office you are a pilot of the Imperial Navy. You will demonstrate the proper respect to your senior officer or you will demonstrate how to clean a sewage compactor. Is that clear?",	"s_47691a6":"Report to me when you are ready to attempt the patrol again.",	"s_479":"Why recruit volunteers? Is not the strength of the Emperor's Navy unmatched?",	"s_481":"Imperial technology. So far you've been flying a basic TIE.  The normal TIE is quite a bit more complicated than that.  For one thing, you'll find that you can install better components on it... better weapons, better armor, and so on.",	"s_482":"Starfighter components. With just a little more training, you could be using better weapons.  Missiles can really help to swing the battle your way, and this skill can allow you to use some good ones.",	"s_483":"Space combat training. It's no secret that Imperial pilots utilize some of the best starfighter tactics the galaxy has ever seen.  I can get you started on the road to mastering these uniquely Imperial procedures.",	"s_484":"Navicomputer management. I can teach you how to utilize some of the basic functionality of the droid interface to normalize your shields, overload your weapons, and that sort of thing.",	"s_4854758d":"I would like to request a mission.",	"s_492":"I'm ready to study.",	"s_494":"Good. Report back to me when you're ready for your next assignment.",	"s_496":"I'm ready to study.",	"s_498":"Good. Report back to me when you're ready for your next assignment.",	"s_4c6875a7":"In this outfit, you serve as I will. Now get out to that patrol. Report to me when you're done.",	"s_4c97441f":"Report to me when you have completed your mission. May the Emperor guide you to victory.",	"s_4d41f7fe":"Dismissed.",	"s_4d7a1ae4":"Spaced him. Now, about my fee?",	"s_4e95ac78":"Service Pilot Initiate, it is beyond my understanding how you could fail to achieve the objective of flying such a simple circuit patrol.",	"s_4efae056":"I'm surprised those pirates didn't turn your ship into a burning heap. Here's your payment. Report back to me when you're ready for another job.",	"s_500":"I'm ready to study.",	"s_502":"Good. Report back to me when you're ready for your next assignment.",	"s_504":"I'm ready to study.",	"s_506":"Good. Report back to me when you're ready for your next assignment.",	"s_506aa7cf":"Sorry, pilot, but you are carrying way too much stuff. I hope you don't take all of that into your ship with you. Drop some of it and come back for your form.",	"s_5070b6e":"Very good. By the powers vested in me by the Imperial Naval Command, under the ever watchful eye of the Emperor, I hereby conscript you to service with the non-officer flight rank of Pilot Initiate. May you serve the Empire dutifully. Welcome to the Imperial Navy.",	"s_518959d2":"Good, I have a lot of work for you. Pirate activity in the area is still fairly high. There are plenty of pirates to hunt or you could help escort transports moving supplies.",	"s_523f6698":"This sounds like something that might be worthy.",	"s_52b712dc":"(Relate the details of the distress call.)",	"s_561d4b08":"I will have you confined if you cannot control yourself.",	"s_565cc8ba":"I live only to serve the Emperor, sir.",	"s_566cddb5":"This is a patrol and only a patrol. The purpose of the assignment is to assess your ability to pilot a ship and follow basic instructions. I will be very surprised if you manage to succeed.

Is this clear, Pilot Initiate?",	"s_59c8db72":"Sir, yes, sir!",	"s_5b34a8a8":"In the Imperial Navy we don't pick our postings, they pick us. The Naval Command feels you make a good candidate for Security.",	"s_5c4e4259":"Whatever. Like I said before, just name the target and the price.",	"s_5c5b19e2":"Yes, Sir!",	"s_5c709097":"It is not the Emperor's will.",	"s_5c8922d8":"That's the spirit, Pilot Initiate!

Now I want to be paid.",	"s_5fdd32ea":"Excellent. Deliver a report to me upon completion of the mission.",	"s_601e26c5":"Here's your salary for the operation and another bonus for exceptional duty. I also received your Imperial flight suit, but you'll never fit into this...Why don't you take this bandolier, instead.  At least you can keep your things organized.  Your helmet will take a while longer, the inertia electronics have to be calibrated for every pilot. You wouldn't want to black out during a fast maneuver.",	"s_60c81a4c":"Absolutely, sir.",	"s_6138854f":"Do you have business with the Imperial Navy? No? Then I suggest that you come back another time.",	"s_61f0326":"Figured if I didn't, you wouldn't pay me.",	"s_627065f5":"I work alone and then I get paid.",	"s_6337731b":"I suggest you reign in your enthusiasm.

Report back to me when you've completed the objective.",	"s_63380f34":"I've always been an independent agent. I work alone.",	"s_63f41edf":"A glorious achievement, I'm sure. You responded to a rapidly changing situation, eliminated the enemy, and helped secure valuable medical supplies. The Naval Command is pleased with your adaptability.",	"s_64b01ff":"That may be, but they haven't stood on the command deck of an Imperial Star Destroyer while facing down a squadron of enemy hostiles. Sir, I have no time for the Imperial Inquisition. My record shows that I am a patriot.",	"s_65dcd253":"I'd rather suck plasma than work for you.",	"s_668cac00":"I need to think about the mission and figure out what went wrong.",	"s_66ac46dc":"A patrol is somewhat less than my ability. I prefer a warrior's assignment.",	"s_670201ae":"I need a ship.",	"s_6705894e":"Service in the Imperial Navy isn't to be taken lightly. You'll be expected to follow orders and any association with the Rebellion would be punished severely.  Are you sure you want to sign up? You aren't exactly Imperial Pilot quality.",	"s_6868d86b":"Return to me when you are ready to take the mission.",	"s_68c831e7":"Yes. I want to be in the Imperial Navy.",	"s_6942663f":"Recently, Rebel opposition has become more direct. We want to recruit new pilots for support duty, freeing up combat pilots for the front lines. Under normal circumstances it takes years of formal education to become a flight officer in the Imperial Navy.",	"s_6942ec7e":"You want me to eliminate him.",	"s_6971748f":"So, it seems I was right after all. Your success with the pirates was just luck and the trust of Naval Command was misplaced. I suppose you could try hunting down the pirates again, but you would probably still fail.",	"s_6988fd93":"Now then, your mission. Bestine has become a key base location for Imperial Naval operations in the Outer Rim. Many ships and men are moved through this region on a daily basis. Ships and men consume supplies and uninterrupted delivery of supplies is critical to the integrity of base operations.",	"s_69d5148f":"Thank you sir.",	"s_6a128385":"What is a duty?",	"s_6a7d2af7":"The purpose of the mission is to assess your ability to pilot a ship and follow basic instructions. If you pass, you will be considered for more dangerous assignments. You are to report back to me upon completion. Is this clear, Pilot Initiate?",	"s_6b63ee3":"Stand at attention, Pilot. Having shown skill in combat situations you are being elevated to an Outer Rim security detail. For the time being, I will handle your assignments, briefings, and deployment.

Good day then.",	"s_6d8d3e00":"I will not fail you, sir.",	"s_6e62e955":"You should be. An officer rank is usually only given to those who graduate Naval Command School.

The Empire has recognized your ability and has seen fit to elevate you to the lowest rank of the command echelon.",	"s_6fcaa2a":"You've earned it, pilot. You have exceeded the expectations of this program and of myself. Your duty has not ended, however. Return when you are ready to take on another operation.",	"s_701f8a8e":"Report back to me when you are ready for your next mission.",	"s_703a1e55":"Now, do you have further business here?

Imperial Naval Command believes a decisive strike against the pirates would cripple, if not eliminate, their operations in this system.",	"s_72ed61c":"Yes, volunteers. Under normal circumstances it takes years of formal education to become a flight officer in the Imperial Navy. Recently, Rebel opposition has become more direct.

That may be what the men and women of the Death Star found, but out here its business as usual. This war will be won through the daily effort of loyal officers doing their assigned duties, not the heroics of a single SpecOps ghost.",	"s_7fdc4805":"As a member of this Navy you will be expected to work with the team when necessary. Your assignments, while small, are critical to Imperial interests in the Outer Rim. If I need you to work with others to achieve those goals, you will do so and you will like it. Is that clear?",	"s_7ff3bffd":"It never changes with you does it. Here's your payment as well as a bonus for saving the transport. I also received your Imperial flight suit. At least try to look like a pilot and wear it while you're on duty.",	"s_8273f08f":"Naval Command will be pleased. I didn't expect someone like you to be such an asset to the Empire.",	"s_82f901aa":"Report back to me when you are ready for another duty.",	"s_838b6daf":"They died cursing my name.",	"s_83d1f7de":"Understood, sir!",	"s_83ea480b":"(Glare) Very well. Sir.",	"s_83fa9322":"Give me an update on the status of your operation against the pirate leader, pilot.",	"s_83fc71cf":"What kind of assignment is it?",	"s_84047858":"(Glare at him, violently.)",	"s_84cc9ca1":"The Imperial Navy prides itself on the character and loyalty of its officers. I don't think you understand what it means to be a patriot. The lines are drawn, citizen. You are either with us or you are a Rebel. There is no neutral ground.",	"s_853678d0":"I have an assignment for you. As you know, ships travel to and from Bestine every day along the Primary Commerce Route.

Don't abuse that trust. Commander Oberhaur of the ISD Accuser will handle your assignments from this point on.",	"s_9237617f":"What about training?",	"s_92c85144":"You flubbed a simple operation. This patrol should have been flawless.",	"s_930b7f4c":"Your job is to locate and eliminate the pirate leader at the coordinates I have given you. Imperial Naval Command believes a decisive strike against the pirates would cripple, if not eliminate, their operations in this system.",	"s_93b4f46e":"Cdr. Oberhaur is friendly, but a tough man. He'll work you hard. You aren't officially a member of Storm Squadron yet. You need to impress Cdr. Oberhaur during the application phase to be accepted.

You got a job for me or what?",	"s_976ec302":"Calm down, your payment has been arranged. I've also taken the liberty of submitting your physical profile to the Commissions Office.

Keep your guns cold unless you are fired upon first.",	"s_abffcfd7":"Pirate activity is still high enough that we need combat capable pilots on active duty locating and eliminating them.

No doubt they will also realize that part of your success came from my masterful instruction. I think you may have done us both a great service.",	"s_b737f77e":"I have other things to attend to, good day.",	"s_b7c14c03":"Good morning. My name is Lieutenant Akal Colzet, Imperial Navy.

I would be honored to hunt the enemies of the Empire.",	"s_bc6327c0":"I don't like working with bounty hunters like you. For a soldier, killing is a necessary evil. You seem to get some kind of thrill from it.",	"s_bc695163":"I can clear you for a new TIE Fighter, but only the basic model. Are you sure you want a new control device?",	"s_bc7382d4":"'We are but a tool to achieve that end.' I, too, know the text of the Imperial Doctrine. It's an element of core officer training.

I have been authorized to give you special instruction.",	"s_c3e56b53":"Perhaps.",	"s_c48451bf":"I don't expect you will run into trouble, as many ships safely move through the region every day, but be on guard.

I think it's time for a promotion.",	"s_d25c510b":"Duty missions are open ended assignments. They end when you choose to end them. For example, if I assign you the task of hunting pirates, you can hunt as many pirates as you want. You can end the duty any time from the mission entry in your datapad.
