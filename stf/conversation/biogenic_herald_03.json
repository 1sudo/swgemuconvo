In fact, I don't even think they know where it is exactly. Sounds like it's a big secret, but they said something about asking the locals. Something about a Mining Outpost, too.",		"s_c2f063ae":"Sure, tell me what you know.",		"s_b3ba542c":"I'm sorry, but I've got to go.",		"s_a5ee5a5b":"My pleasure. Take care!",		"s_9e41444d":"Did they say what was happening?",		"s_8ae9c189":"Sure, sure, I understand. I'll still be here if you get a chance to come back.",		"s_7fd67d96":"Well, a couple of Imperial types were in here not long ago, and I overheard their conversation. It sounded like they were talking about something going down on Yavin IV.",		"s_5ea784e0":"My pleasure. If it sounds like something you want to look into, you might like to ask around that Mining Outpost on Yavin IV yourself.",		"s_569d6129":"Hello. You are sympathetic to the Rebellion are you not? I have information that may be of interest to you if you are willing to hear it.",		"s_3d816e72":"No, they didn't. In fact, I don't even think they know where it is exactly, except for on Yavin IV. Sounds like it's a big secret, but they said something about asking the locals. Something about a Mining Outpost, too.",		"s_2b10b66c":"Did they mention where the facility is?",		"s_2991cadd":"I'm really not sure. It got a little loud in here and I couldn't make out what they were saying, but one of them looked really mad. If you ask me something big is about to go down.",		"s_1b751405":"Thanks for the information. Good-bye.",		"s_1711fd92":"I didn't catch everything that they were saying, but I did hear something about an Imperial agent overseeing a bio-genetics research facility. And something about... Geo, uh... Geonosians, yea. That's it.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (biogenic_herald_03.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
