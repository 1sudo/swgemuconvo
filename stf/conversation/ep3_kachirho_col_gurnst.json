You back to do some more Wookiee hunting or did you just miss me?",	"s_126":"I am up for another round of hunting.",	"s_128":"Right. Same deal as before. You hunt down and kill fifteen members of the Wookiee resistance and I pay you a bounty. Well? Get moving, bub.",	"s_130":"Yeah, that's it...I missed you.",	"s_132":"Don't get all mushy on me or anything. I don't have time to chat with anyone who is just standing around gawking.",	"s_134":"I take it from that big grin on your face that the job is done. Those Wookiees should have known better then to mess with someone like you. Good job, bub.",	"s_136":"Um, my payment?",	"s_138":"Yeah, I suppose you want to get paid. Well here you go, bub. If you are interested there are still more Wookiees that need a lesson taught to them. Same deal as before...kill me fifteen resistance members and I will pay you a bounty.",	"s_140":"Sure. I will keep hunting them.",	"s_142":"That's the spirit. I figured you had a mean streak in you a click wide. Don't just stand there...get moving! Those Wookiees are not going to kill themselves you know.",	"s_144":"Na, I think I will look elsewhere for adventure.",	"s_146":"Your choice. If you change your mind come back and see me.",	"s_148":"Maybe you didn't hear me clearly the first time. I hired you to go out and kill fifteen of those Wookiee resistance members. Until you have accomplished that simple task I don't really see any reason for us to become all friendly like.",	"s_150":"So, what will it be bub? Are you here looking for adventure or are you just going to walk around and smell the pretty flowers? If it is the prior then maybe you and I should talk. If it is the latter maybe you would do better on another world.",	"s_152":"Well, I am here. Start talking.",	"s_154":"Kashyyyk has a problem. And that problem is that the natives don't seem to understand their defined role. That is why I am here. I am putting together a task force to wipe out that resistance. If you are interested I will swear you in right now and get you on the path of fortune and glory.",	"s_156":"Defined by who?",	"s_158":"The Empire, of course. They are not interested in sending valuable soldiers all the way out here to help squelch this resistance but at the same time they cannot just turn a blind eye to those disobedient furballs. They hired me to come out here and set things right.",	"s_160":"You don't look like an Imperial officer.",	"s_162":"I am a merc, bub. I work for credits not for some misplaced ideal of those soldier boys. Now I don't have all day for chit-chat. You in or are you out?",	"s_164":"I will at least listen to what the offer is.",	"s_166":"Ok, then. If you are interested in working for me, you are going to head out and liquidate members of the Wookiee resistance. You eliminate the problem and I pay you for services rendered. Do we have a deal?",	"s_168":"We have a deal.",	"s_170":"By the powers invested in me...blah, blah, blah...you are now authorized to kill members of the Wookiee resistance. For every fifteen of those bums you kill come back to me and I will issue you the bounty.",	"s_172":"Where can I find these Wookiees?",	"s_174":"If we knew that they would be dead already. All I know is that there are rumors of them operating somewhere in the area around Kachirho. Now beat it bub, you have work to do.",	"s_176":"Roger that. Off I go.",	"s_178":"Good, I like people who don't ask very many questions.",	"s_180":"I changed my mind. Bye.",	"s_182":"I am out. See you later.",	"s_184":"Well then just move along, bub. You are cramping my style.",	"s_186":"Fortune...glory...sign me up!",	"s_188":"I don't deal with rude people.",	"s_190":"Better get used to it, bub. Kashyyyk isn't the type of place where people can afford to be all nice and polite. Now run along, greenhorn."
