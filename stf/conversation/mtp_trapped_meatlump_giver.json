One of the Meatlumps never made it out of the lower maintenance areas. I think he's trapped down there. Can you find him for me?",	"s_13":"Okay.",	"s_15":"Oh good. You'll have to be fast, though. He's probably raised an alarm by now. I wouldn't risk more than about ten or so minutes down there.",	"s_17":"No thanks.",	"s_19":"Couldn't rescue him in time, eh? I knew security would be close on your heels.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Yeah, we probably shouldn't risk anyone else getting lost down there.",	"s_4":"You rescued him! What a relief. Thank you!!",	"s_7":"Go find that lost Meatlump. He's somewhere in the lower maintenance areas.",	"s_9":"No one else has gotten trapped lately, but it seems to happen a lot. Check back later in case I need your help again."
