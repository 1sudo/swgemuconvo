You are already many hours late.",	"s_4cc97351":"Pannaqa has been waiting for you for quite a while, Shendo. He needs that vibro-tiller part.",	"s_552042df":"Show me the drink to go way. I'm home and I wanna go drink....",	"s_6abc7ab9":"No kidding eh?  I guess I should probably get on that huh?",	"s_70fea75d":"Um, hello?",	"s_7bbf7ffe":"I don't think I can trust you to finish the job.",	"s_9035e1f5":"Um, who?",	"s_b6307da0":"Deal.
