He can get you set up as an Alliance Pilot!",	"s_1162efff":"It is my destiny.",	"s_14aade81":"Do you teach?",	"s_1628fad8":"Good luck, then!",	"s_17edec66":"First, who are you?",	"s_17eec115":"Stinks to fail missions doesn't it?",	"s_1ae7f565":"I wish you good luck, my friend.",	"s_1c48bff0":"Survival?",	"s_27b64c88":"Hey... so tell me. How are things going?",	"s_2895a98":"When you launch, your ship computer system will create a 'launch waypoint' that you can use to find your way back. Keep this point active by opening your datapad, choosing the waypoint labeled 'Launch Waypoint', and choosing to 'Activate' it.",	"s_2b5181ae":"My name is Kiizete. I am a technician.",	"s_2e823c5f":"Just talk to the droid. He'll take it from there!",	"s_2f212745":"Destiny has drawn me here.",	"s_34d8b295":"I think you're scared.",	"s_3704b308":"What do I do up there?",	"s_3e796521":"Fly back to a space station. Comm the space station and tell them you want to land.",	"s_4669a3e4":"Yeah. I'll tell you about it sometime.",	"s_46b93374":"Its memory is defunct. Got an old pilot program in it. I gotta remove it... but it's proving to be difficult.",	"s_46dcc469":"Nice to meet you, %NU. What are you doing around here?",	"s_489ec48f":"Sort of. I normally work a shift on the Kai'rek mining ship... but I got tagged by pirates on my first day of shore leave. I figure I'll need to run a few more contracts here on Naboo before I can afford to pay for repairs.",	"s_49a108e5":"Sorry! Keep your cool, okay?",	"s_4bd66142":"Couldn't be better.",	"s_4c90db01":"We're doing just fine.",	"s_4ed31d3f":"How do I land?",	"s_5655b98e":"Don't beat yourself up about it. Just get back up there and try again.",	"s_565d17f2":"For now, maybe. But I'm going to fix that. So... let me get back to it!",	"s_5aff38e2":"We'll see about that...",	"s_5c46c104":"The starship terminal in the starport will allow you to do that. Go to the starport, and use the ship terminal to launch.",	"s_5dc9a083":"You don't need to worry.",	"s_5df1433d":"Yes. It does.",	"s_5e15545":"Is this your job?",	"s_6103a248":"My destiny is different.",	"s_61657d0f":"I see.",	"s_6472f6c1":"Yeah. I really miss flying! I can't wait to get my ship repaired.",	"s_65372fa4":"I hear things about a mysterious wing of TIE fighters. Like the Empire is relocating some combat school to the Naboo system. Stinks! We'll have squints crawling all over us!",	"s_65e8c460":"So you're part of the Alliance now. How does it feel?",	"s_670bb9d5":"Any pointers?",	"s_695e9ca2":"What makes you think I would have anything to do with that?",	"s_69a02cf2":"I am excited!",	"s_6a1ce31d":"Well, I'm not.",	"s_6a22af26":"Then get to it! Grab hold of that droid and get your ship codes and flight clearance!",	"s_6bd02793":"Nothing.",	"s_6d949f10":"A contract?",	"s_705da14d":"Sorry to hear that.",	"s_7136aa3f":"But you know that this is your calling? Did it come to you in a dream? I'm not trying to insult you - I do have dreams myself from time to time... sitting in a cockpit, blasting TIE fighters left and right!",	"s_77e48d5b":"What do you mean?",	"s_7a0420ae":"I'm serious. I don't have time for you right now!",	"s_7c075dce":"How do I get out of here?",	"s_7fa15433":"What's wrong with it?",	"s_82288395":"I hope you're right.",	"s_8379d6bb":"It's got this old pilot trainer program burned into it. Empire wants it out of there. It's not going to be easy, though. Moisture from the pond has gummed up this droid's circuitry. I'm going to have to replace a lot of parts!",	"s_85d464bf":"Are you kidding me?",	"s_861c2497":"You did, huh? Why don't you talk to V3 over there. He has a state-of-the-art Alliance Pilot training program!",	"s_8668104f":"Your starship?",	"s_88b50e":"Yeah... sure... a contract.",	"s_890f3624":"Use SHIFT+C to target it and open communication with the station commander. You can choose to repair your ship or land.",	"s_8920c0f2":"I think you just might.",	"s_8a824d71":"Well, maybe not. It's just the best that we can afford out here on Naboo. The Alliance doesn't have many friends in this system. It works, though. It's a very effective program.",	"s_8bf64edf":"I don't know what to do next!",	"s_8dbe594":"I'm living it! Back off!",	"s_8dee77bb":"I do odd jobs, okay? And I need to get back to this one...",	"s_92a0a895":"You should talk to the droid...",	"s_933941d0":"This droid is going to be the death of me! I'm sorry... I'm getting nowhere with this thing and I really need to get back home.",	"s_93f420a0":"It's all falling apart.",	"s_95658182":"I don't know yet...",	"s_9940f453":"I got a recruitment email from the Alliance.",	"s_9cd181e7":"I see. Pretty intense. For me it's just a question of survival.",	"s_9d788910":"I see, %NU... What destiny are you talking about?",	"s_9ddf5e8a":"Why reprogram it?",	"s_9f32bc26":"Yes. Like that.",	"s_a5edd9e5":"No. Never really got the urge to teach piloting. Try the droid... He's good.",	"s_a5fe9928":"I'll take care of it.",	"s_a65b9c24":"How do I comm a space station?",	"s_a95b1747":"To save the galaxy!",	"s_af558512":"A '95. Hand-me-down. Look, I really need to get back to work...",	"s_afd1368":"How do I use it?",	"s_b26194cb":"What are you doing here?",	"s_b369f7cd":"I know what you mean.",	"s_b41e5c00":"Meh.",	"s_b78a2c76":"Look. Go to the starport. Find a terminal and launch into space. The war isn't going to wait for you!",	"s_b9934459":"Me? No. I never made it as a fighter pilot. Sorry.",	"s_bc76e9cc":"Dee'ja. My starship is grounded for the moment. I'm fulfilling a contract for the Empire right now. Got to get this droid's memory wiped and rebuilt.",	"s_bd21db14":"Take it easy. What don't you understand?",	"s_bdc96417":"Sorry. I really don't have time to talk right now. I've been trying to get this droid reprogrammed all day. It's turning out to be a nightmare!",	"s_c1499ae3":"Fly your route. Keep a low profile. Don't get into anything you can't handle. Come home safe.",	"s_c261cfae":"No problem.",	"s_c39cb5eb":"I've come to join the Rebel Alliance.",	"s_c4682ea6":"Thanks!",	"s_c899d08d":"I want to join the Rebel Alliance!",	"s_c9274747":"State-of-the-art?",	"s_ca776e30":"Who are you?",	"s_ca932c28":"Forget it.",	"s_cbba56ce":"I thought you would be excited.",	"s_ce894b84":"Just doing my duty.",	"s_cff6adcf":"It's interesting you say that. I hear the Alliance is scrambling to stay ahead of the Empire in the Naboo system. You're tangled up with a mystery squadron of rookie TIE fighters... or something... What are you hearing?",	"s_d2083ee4":"Nothing. Forget I said anything.",	"s_dd3ba522":"Order of the Empire! What can you do? I just grabbed the contract from a terminal up in Dee'ja Peak.",	"s_dff67cdc":"You erase droids on a mining ship?",	"s_e22b6287":"Ah. I probably wouldn't understand anyhow... Take care!",	"s_e518378e":"(Give Kiizete your name)",	"s_e5aa590e":"Where will I find a space station?",	"s_e5b2f859":"For what?",	"s_e97d81c5":"How do I launch?",	"s_ea3a9cb0":"I've taken a contract to reprogram the droid... but it's proving to be a lot harder than anyone thought it would be. Maybe impossible!",	"s_ed72de53":"The Alliance needs me.",	"s_ee55c9ed":"Where's home?",	"s_f6c52e55":"Take care.",	"s_fc27931b":"Thanks.",	"s_fd0a45a7":"Well, just be safe up there. Okay?",	"s_fdbd2351":"What do you fly?",	"s_fe562082":"Walk directly down the stairs... then wade into the water and slosh toward the starport. It's fun!",	"s_ff33d98b":"That droid is an Alliance training droid!"
