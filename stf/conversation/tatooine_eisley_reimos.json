Which computers do I access?",	"s_139":"It should be in the medlab. I can't be sure this time since it's a closed system.",	"s_140":"Ok, I'm headed back.",	"s_141":"Be careful in there.",	"s_142":"Nice work. You really set the record straight.",	"s_143":"You must get in there and destroy that data before it ends up in the wrong hands.",	"s_145":"I can't find all the terminals.",	"s_146":"You should be able to use the same medical computer you used last time.",	"s_147":"Ok, I'll try again.",	"s_148":"So many are depending on you.",	"s_158":"I'm not getting a signal from the surveillance virus. Have you planted it yet?",	"s_160":"No, where is the computer terminal?",	"s_162":"It should be just inside the building. Look in the first room.",	"s_164":"Ok, thanks.",	"s_165":"Looks like I am done with Jabba.",	"s_166":"He called me too. Looks like you earned freedom for us both.",	"s_167":"Glad I could help you too, Reimos.",	"s_168":"Don't get soft here in Mos Eisley friend. Not many of us helpful types left.",	"s_169":"Good work on taking out the data. I got word from Jabba, his reaction to Durr's treachery was predictable; he wants Durr dead.",	"s_170":"Jabba just called. Can I tell him the target is dead?",	"s_180":"Anytime, good luck.",	"s_183":"So do I.",	"s_184":"I can't argue with that. I say we kill Durr for our own reasons.",	"s_186":"I'll shoot him twice. Once for each of us.",	"s_187":"Yeah, let's clean up that trash.",	"s_189":"How's it going? Dunir said you do good work. No questions asked.",	"s_192":"Not yet.",	"s_193":"Well hurry up, Jabba is losing his patience.",	"s_198":"Well, there is one question. When am I going to be square with Jabba?",	"s_2":"",	"s_200":"I have nothing to do with that.",	"s_202":"Why did you want to see me?",	"s_204":"Jabba is interested in some subordinates of his. He thinks they may not be as loyal as they profess. If rumors are true one of his subordinates may be up to something.",	"s_215":"Have you talked to Tori yet?",	"s_219":"Was I supposed to?",	"s_221":"Yes, did you forget her location data?",	"s_223":"Yes",	"s_225":"No, I'll go there now.",	"s_227":"Goodbye.",	"s_229":"Here is the data, Goodbye.",	"s_262":"Where can I find him?",	"s_263":"I would start in the communal area, if he's not there check the dormitory.",	"s_264":"Time to get started.",	"s_265":"Take him down.",	"s_266":"I'm going to need time to track their data. Bib asked me to get you to talk to Tori. She has work for you.",	"s_267":"Where can I find her?",	"s_268":"Here's the information for your datapad.",	"s_269":"Thanks.",	"s_270":"No problem.",	"s_275":"What's wrong?",	"s_276":"I need the mission information again.",	"s_277":"Jabba is interested in some subordinates of his. He thinks they may not be as loyal as they profess.",	"s_280":"I understand. So what do you need me to do?",	"s_281":"What do you need now?",	"s_282":"I need the information again, I forgot it.",	"s_283":"It looks like the White Thranta manager is running some medical research, but the general data doesn't have any details.",	"s_284":"Well?",	"s_285":"What do I do now?",	"s_286":"I told you.",	"s_287":"Tell me again, please.",	"s_288":"I need you to destroy the information in that medical computer.",	"s_289":"Is he dead?",	"s_290":"Is who dead?",	"s_291":"Durr!",	"s_292":"Maybe you should tell me what I need to do again.",	"s_293":"Jabba wants his traitorous henchmen dead. We want him dead because he is doing medical experiments on people. Remember now?",	"s_297":"I need you to introduce a surveillance virus into their network so I can look around in their data.",	"s_299":"Did you kill him?",	"s_300":"I killed him, but I don't think I am finished.",	"s_301":"The information from the data you collected from the company's computers seems to indicate the real boss is Brok. I think you should take him out as well.",	"s_302":"According to Durr's datapad he was attempting to slice into the White Thranta payroll computer. It apprears he was not happy with his pay. He didn't appear to be successful, but he did get as far as the security systems database. Maybe you can find something of value using his slice technique.",	"s_303":"Ok, I can do that.",	"s_304":"Good luck.",	"s_305":"I will go slice their computer with this technique.",	"s_306":"Good luck.",	"s_308":"Vourk said you were working for him.",	"s_310":"What!? Shh! Listen, we don't want to talk about that right now. Let's just play the good Jabba henchman role and we will do what needs to be done when it's time. Until then, let's just be quiet about our contacts, understand?",	"s_312":"Yeah, sorry. Back to business. Why did you want to see me?",	"s_314":"Be careful in Mos Eisley. You never know what's just around the corner in this town.",	"s_316":"I'm always careful.",	"s_318":"Not careful enough to avoid talking to me.",	"s_320":"Right. I'll leave you to that.",	"s_322":"See ya.",	"s_332":"I'm on my way.",	"s_334":"Good luck.",	"s_344":"You had better pay well, or I will be looking for you.",	"s_346":"If this information turns out to be as juicy as it seems I think we'll both be eating Bantha steaks tonight.",	"s_348":"I'm a vegetarian, but I get your point. I'm in.",	"s_350":"...with a cold Corellian ale on the side. I like the way you think.",	"s_358":"This isn't just a shipping company is it?",	"s_360":"No it isn't. It doesn't matter anymore, you're going to find out eventually. This is a front for Jabba's smuggling operations. They also have a tracking station deep inside the bunker.",	"s_362":"Still doesn't explain the bacta.",	"s_364":"It's also a safehouse for smugglers. It has medical facilities but the manager is using those for something sinister. I need you to access their data on the medical terminals.",	"s_366":"I see, and the manager is using it for darker purposes?",	"s_368":"Find your way to the medical facilities and access their computer.",	"s_370":"On my way.",	"s_372":"Good luck.",	"s_374":"Tracking station? For what?",	"s_376":"Jabba built it to track all the space traffic around Tatooine. He knows when any ship comes or goes and when smugglers are on time.",	"s_378":"Sounds complicated.",	"s_380":"It's expensive, also. If you're as paranoid as Jabba, I suppose it would be worth it to you.",	"s_382":"I suppose, still doesn't explain the bacta.",	"s_384":"Yes, that is heartbreaking. Am I done with Jabba yet or not?",	"s_386":"Aren't you interested in the details?",	"s_388":"Only the details surrounding my deal with Jabba.",	"s_412":"We must do something.",	"s_414":"Agreed. Do you think you can make your way in there again? I need you to log into their medical computer again. This time we'll destroy their research.",	"s_416":"Destroy it? Shouldn't we give this to the authorities?",	"s_418":"This is Mos Eisley. There are no authorities. The only authority is the person still standing when the shooting stops. We have to erase their work. It will set them back to square one.",	"s_420":"What about Jabba?",	"s_422":"Jabba doesn't know what Durr is doing. I can't risk Jabba getting his hands on this data.",	"s_424":"Yeah, there's no telling what Jabba would use it for.",	"s_426":"Or even continue the work, but there is no way I'm letting this information fall into his hands.",	"s_428":"Yeah, I think that would be a really bad idea.",	"s_440":"I'll make sure he hears about your heroism, but I need you to destroy the information in that medical computer.",	"s_442":"Jabba doesn't want this information?",	"s_444":"Jabba doesn't know about this information, and I'm going to make sure the slimy slug never finds out. Get my drift?",	"s_458":"Yeah, I can agree with you there.",	"s_460":"So are you going to help me destroy the data?",	"s_462":"You bet, anything to stick it to the disgusting slob.",	"s_464":"Good. Be careful in there.",	"s_466":"So you will destroy the data?",	"s_468":"Count me in.",	"s_470":"Thanks.",	"s_89":"Looks like the rumors are true. The manager is using the shipping company for his own purposes.",	"s_91":"What do you mean?",	"s_93":"Give me a moment to scan the data...I can't believe Durr would do this! He's abducting people and performing genetic alterations on them. Then he disposes of the remains, living or not!",	"s_94":"It looks like he's running some medical research, but they're going through a lot of...bacta."
