It's not like there's any chance we would actually fail, now is there?",	"s_12":"Mr. Covington has already filled me in on what you and he are doing. Can't say I completely approve of what you're doing, but can't say I disapprove either.",	"s_14":"Can you help?",	"s_16":"I think I can. Should be easy enough. I'll provide you with an access code for the Corellia Times News Archive terminal in Coronet. Simply go look up the reports I did on the kidnapping.",	"s_17":"Sounds like they unquestionably deserve what's coming.",	"s_18":"Hmm...probably true. Return to Mr. Covington. I'm certain he's eager to put this information to use.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Nothing like a peaceful day in Narmle. This is the perfect place to have retired to...ah, who am I kidding. I miss Corellia.",	"s_5":"Yes, this is it. The last two kidnappers are Vladlun Travan and Jurgen Nath. Vladlun was the one who planned and organized the crime while Jurgen was simply hired muscle. A true thug that one...probably cared more about the opportunity to hurt someone than for making some credits.",	"s_7":"I wish you well in your endeavour. Such acts may perhaps be unsavory, but, at times, they are necessary."
