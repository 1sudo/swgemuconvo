You're new at this, aren't you?",	"s_15":"Is that the best you've got? Try using some flourishes.",	"s_17":"May I help you, citizen?",	"s_19":"I've been sent here to entertain you.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"I beg your pardon?",	"s_23":"Mira thought that you could use a break. I've been sent to dance for you.",	"s_25":"Sure. I could use a break. I only have a minute to watch, though.",	"s_27":"A bit. How did you know?",	"s_28":"My sister is a professional dancer. She practiced a lot, and I had the duty to guard her before I joined the Imperial Navy.",	"s_29":"I'll bet that your duties are much different now.",	"s_30":"They are, for certain. Like now, I'm looking into a missing bit of cargo. Frankly, I'd rather be back guarding my sister.",	"s_31":"Cargo? What kind of cargo?",	"s_32":"It's a long story, and most of it is classified information. But, I can say that an object of high value was stolen from an Imperial ship in transit to Coruscant.",	"s_33":"That's terrible!",	"s_34":"It's going to be worse for the thief. I'm authorized to use any force necessary to bring back the stolen arti..object.",	"s_35":"Good luck with your career.",	"s_36":"Hello, citizen. I'm sorry, but I cannot help you right now. I have some investigating to do."
