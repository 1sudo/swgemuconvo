Just tell me where you need to go and leave the rest to me.",	"s_22":"I need to be dropped off in the crater of that volcano.",	"s_24":"Volcano crater flight, eh? Lava shooting up all around us. Intense heat. High risk factor. That will be no problem at all. One thing I learned about flying around this rock is that if you come in low, the heat from the lava helps keep your ship up...most of the time.",	"s_26":"That's great. But I really need to get up there...now!",	"s_28":"Say no more...say no more. We can leave at once. Hold onto your hat...or whatever. This is going to be a bumpy ride. Is your party ready to go?",	"s_29":"I am ready.",	"s_30":"Not yet.",	"s_31":"That is what I like to hear.
