I'd be careful who you wave it in front of, but it should serve you well. ",	"s_15":"Ah, you are on the next step, already? Very good. I will look forward to speaking with you when you are done.",	"s_17":"Nos'lyn thinks that you are doing well.

He said that you are a very promising pupil. I can see what he means.",	"s_24":"Of course I am! How could you not know me?",	"s_26":"Hmmm. Nos'lyn may be wrong about you.
