What kind of merchant sells ship parts that they can't deliver?!!? Not exactly a model way to run a business. I'm not buying anything from this guy ever again.",	"s_4668c9d5":"I'll tell you what happened. We paid for ship parts that this guy doesn't have. Oh sure, he claimed they'd be delivered with his next shipment, but it's been days now. Where's this mythical shipment? Starships don't just disappear! Well, not normally.",	"s_7":"This is just great!! Our shipment of ship parts is finally located, but now it has apparently become involved in some spice smuggling investigation. CorSec is holding the entire shipment as evidence. At this rate, we'll never be able to get back to work. I think we were better off when the shipment was simply missing.",	"s_79bcfacd":"Spare me the lecture. My comrade has already given me that one more than enough times. I want the parts I paid for. Not empty words!",	"s_9cc3fb32":"Sometimes you just have to have patience.",	"s_e5210282":"Why not? What happened?"
