Try asking the merchant. It's the least he could do.",		"s_9cc3fb32":"Sometimes you just have to have patience.",		"s_8dd47fdc":"Could I ask you some questions?",		"s_79bcfacd":"Spare me the lecture. My comrade has already given me that one more than enough times. I want the parts I paid for. Not empty words!",		"s_5ff8baab":"I was wondering if you could answer some questions?",		"s_4668c9d5":"I'll tell you what happened. We paid for ship parts that this guy doesn't have. Oh sure, he claimed they'd be delivered with his next shipment, but it's been days now. Where's this mythical shipment? Starships don't just disappear! Well, not normally.",		"s_252f6fb9":"I cannot believe we have been wasting our time standing here. What kind of merchant sells ship parts that they can't deliver?!!? Not exactly a model way to run a business. I'm not buying anything from this guy ever again.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (greeter_coronet_shipwright_impatient.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
