That's impossible...",	"s_105":"Nonsense, I got in, didn't I? Let's get a move on!",	"s_107":"Well our odds are probably better than staying here. Take us outside the prison, in to the jungle away from the guards. This isn't the first time I've been on Dathomir and I know an old Alliance hideout that has an emergency space ship.",	"s_109":"Let's keep moving.",	"s_111":"Give me a second.",	"s_113":"It's not safe here.",	"s_115":"How did you get in here..?",	"s_117":"A prison hasn't been built that can keep me out!",	"s_119":"How about one that can keep you in..?",	"s_79":"",	"s_81":"< You can't understand the Wookiee. >",	"s_83":"Let's move out already!",	"s_85":"I just need to fix something quickly.",	"s_87":"We need to hurry!",	"s_89":"We need to get out of here quickly. We will head for the old Alliance hangar and get an escape ship from there while you get your ship. There's a blockade around the planet that's most likely been informed of our escape by now, so we will need your help again. I hope you brought a fight capable ship?",	"s_91":"Of course. You got a plan?",	"s_93":"Yes, we need to break through the blockade quickly before they get organized. Meet us at these coordinates up above and come prepared for some trouble.",	"s_95":"To be honest... no.",	"s_97":"Alright, we'll hide in the atmosphere of the planet. When you have found one, meet us at these coordinates above the planet and come prepared to break through the blockade.",	"s_99":"Who are you and how did you get in here?"
