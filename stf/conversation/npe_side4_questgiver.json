I still have more to do.",	"s_16":"Yes. Here are your feathers and teeth.",	"s_17":"Excellent, excellent! Here is your payment. These will look so good next to my sand panther claw and my krayt dragon skull.",	"s_18":"Okay. I'll be waiting for you.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"Thank you again! My wife loves tooth necklaces.",	"s_22":"I have been doing odd jobs here and there.",	"s_24":"I'm interested in procuring some items from the beasties up in the Atrium. I'm willing to pay well for them.",	"s_26":"Why don't you go up and hunt them yourself?",	"s_28":"Well...Inaldra doesn't really want me up there hunting. She says that I will...damage something. I'm a little clumsy with a blaster.",	"s_30":"Clumsy? That's bad. So, what am I to do?",	"s_35":"I'll head there now.",	"s_36":"Thanks!",	"s_38":"I'd be happy to do your hunting for you.",	"s_40":"Head up to the Atrium and hunt the flits there. Bring back four of their feathers for me. Then, when you have those, get seven lizard teeth. I'm making a necklace for my wife, and that will help me a lot.",	"s_42":"I'm willing to pay for experience. When you have completed your training, come back and talk to me.",	"s_48":"I don't like to hunt, actually.",	"s_50":"Ah, my mistake.",	"s_51":"No. You need to do your own hunting.",	"s_52":"Whatever. You're the one turning down extra money."
