And perhaps aid her as well.",	"s_13":"So you are the one who found my rifle, eh? I thank you. Perhaps I could convince you to aid me once again?",	"s_15":"How can I help?",	"s_16":"No thank you. I think I'm done with you people.",	"s_17":"The Sennex pirates have established a slave trade in the area. I will not stand for this. I know that they are using a bunker near Anchorhead that poses as a research facility. I ask your help to go there and end their slave trade.",	"s_18":"Very well. Again, I thank you for the assistance you've given. Please travel safely.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Nicely done. Your work should set the Sennex pirates back quite a bit in this area. You have my thanks.",	"s_24":"Please, I am preoccupied at the moment. I must ask your indulgence. My guard outside will see to you if need be.",	"s_35":"Slave trade is an abomination, and I will not stand for it.",	"s_36":"Thank you for aiding my daughter. Perhaps she is correct about the threat posed by those Sandpeople. It is good that steps have been taken to neutralize them. I have another request of you, should you be interested?",	"s_37":"What is it you would like me to do?",	"s_38":"My daughter, Dera, has become obsessed with some Tusken Raiders that recently took up residence in a nearby cave. Please do me the favor of checking on her and ensuring that she is okay.",	"s_39":"No thanks. I'm not interested.",	"s_40":"I see. Well, I cannot fault you. You've done more than most."
