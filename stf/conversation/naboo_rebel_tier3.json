",	"s_172":"You're free to leave.",	"s_17c8fb82":"Inquisitors punish and torture Rebels.",	"s_182":"I'm ready to go. Just point the way.",	"s_184":"We've uploaded the coordinates to your database. Be warned, an Imperial Inquisitor is leading the attack. He is your primary target.",	"s_186":"Understood.",	"s_188":"You're free to leave.",	"s_189c01a2":"The Empire is preparing to attack our outpost. We are in desperate need of your help.",	"s_18c308e1":"The leader ship is doing its best to keep a low profile. You'll have to hunt it down in the Endor system. Good luck.",	"s_19fdbf16":"That's one way to put it. They won't translate the data until they get what they want. ",	"s_1a1b97f4":"No. What experiments?",	"s_1ab74446":"You noticed.",	"s_1ba01028":"Not good enough, %NU. You must start over.",	"s_1c058156":"A Bothan base is under attack by Nym's pirates. They are in trouble and need defenders.",	"s_1d69f13f":"No. Are you sending me to fight against the Bothans? ",	"s_1dccb274":"He had useful information, at least.",	"s_1f94856d":"Why are you helping the Bothans?",	"s_209":"When do I leave?",	"s_21aa6c60":"You're free to leave.",	"s_220":"Why?",	"s_223":"And I'm playing defense?",	"s_225":"If you would.",	"s_227":"When do I leave?",	"s_229":"Immediately. Coordinates are already in your ship database. Thank you for your help.",	"s_22fbdd51":"His databank may hold all the secrets of the Force crystals, and every dark detail of the Empire's cybernetic experiments. But we don't know yet. The information is encrypted. And only the Bothans can translate it.",	"s_2330166f":"I'll say. Rebel forces hardly ever attack pirates.",	"s_237":"When do I leave?",	"s_250":"And I'm playing defense?",	"s_252":"If you would.",	"s_254":"When do I leave?",	"s_256":"Immediately. Coordinates are already in your ship database. Thank you for your help.",	"s_2600dae8":"No, not exactly. You will be fighting FOR Bothans. Nym's pirates are attacking one of their bases. They're outgunned, and they need our help.",	"s_267":"What do you need me to do?",	"s_26fbd13e":"If you were a pilot, you wouldn't have to control your feelings. You could vent them with your blasters! ",	"s_2750c5d9":"You still have work to do, young one.",	"s_27f52134":"That's quite the understatement. ",	"s_28d86e3":"There's more. You'll be picking up a new passenger at the outpost.",	"s_2c1e1068":"I'm not the only one. The Bothans are most grateful.",	"s_2c4789b":"Understood.",	"s_2d9a2e66":"It is a rendezvous point for the Vortex. It is, in many ways, our library. It holds a lot of the information we have gathered over the years.",	"s_2e3763ed":"We want to learn more about how the Empire is using those crystals. Have you heard about their medical experiments?",	"s_2f1094c2":"My pleasure. That Inquisitor put up a good fight.",	"s_2f820fac":"To be sure. Vrovel has told you about their cybernetic experiments? ",	"s_30760d01":"Give me another shot.",	"s_312":"In what area do I need to be trained?",	"s_313":"I'll get one of our pilots to teach you about space superiority fighters. When you're done, I will have another mission for you.",	"s_314":"I'll get one of our pilots to teach you about advanced starship component use. When you're done, I will have another mission for you.",	"s_315":"I'll get one of our pilots to teach you about advanced space combat. When you're done, I will have another mission for you.",	"s_3154a04f":"I think the Force is an old wives' tale.",	"s_316":"I'll get one of our pilots to teach you about system balance programming. When you're done, I will have another mission for you.",	"s_31a5e862":"None taken. Are you still willing to help us?  ",	"s_31b106e4":"Well, you were working with that informer. I'm sure he had some secrets.",	"s_3950a8d4":"They won't.",	"s_39b859cf":"I don't know, young one. But I think that very soon WE will be attacking THEM. In the meantime, though, we will simply defend our position and help our Alliance brothers. ",	"s_3c566f87":"I should hope so! How many favors are they going to ask of us?",	"s_3d5f6974":"You handle the cloak and dagger; I'm here to fight. ",	"s_3e7fb8a3":"I appreciate your devotion to the Alliance, but I have nothing for you right now. I suggest you find your commanding officer. ",	"s_3f107c3c":"Imperial ships are attacking a Rebel outpost - one that is very important to us.",	"s_3f38ab04":"Thank you, %NU. Our library is safe now.  ",	"s_401aa65c":"I hope so. Now please hurry. There's not much time.",	"s_40b69b18":"That's life during wartime.",	"s_420c68fc":"I thought you hated them! You're confusing me.",	"s_44fd681b":"Wouldn't you rather be on your ship? You are still on a mission.",	"s_45c4d2ca":"Uh oh. I smell trouble.",	"s_47ae0171":"The rumors are true.  Imperial doctors have found a way to create hybrid, cybernetic pilots.",	"s_4869a9c5":"What was in the translated data?",	"s_49776d50":"You'll be doing more than shooting TIE fighters. The attack is led by an Imperial Inquisitor. He is your primary target. Kill him, and the attacking forces will scatter. ",	"s_4c695dbd":"No.",	"s_4ca47de6":"The Empire doesn't know about the Vortex.",	"s_4ec95981":"Yes it is, my cavalier young friend. But the Vortex must continue. Our work is too important. The Empire is preparing to attack our outpost. We are in desperate need of your help.",	"s_4f707592":"Does the Empire know that?",	"s_4f98b9b7":"You are not helping the Rebellion.",	"s_515906d2":"That spy, you mean! Yes, we were working with him, as you say. We had no choice, unsavory though he was. And now we have his data. It may explain everything about the cybernetic experiments and the Empire's interest in Force Crystals. But it's not in a language we understand.",	"s_51fbaf83":"We need information. They can provide it. That's all. Personal feelings don't come into it.",	"s_51fbced7":"You have failed! Try again, %TU!",	"s_5491ac40":"They are massing their forces for an attack on our outpost, even as we speak.",	"s_54abba14":"Perhaps. In the meantime, there's the business of our outpost. The Empire is preparing to attack. We are in desperate need of your help.",	"s_55d6f6":"Not a problem.",	"s_58ddac81":"I'm trustworthy - AND I'm a good fighter. ",	"s_58ec27cc":"Ha! True enough. But you have your destiny, and I have mine. ",	"s_590bda59":"Well, it's over now. And I've delivered the information to the Sypnet outpost, as ordered.",	"s_5bd69df6":"What do you need me to do?",	"s_5beffaeb":"The Alliance is fortunate to have a pilot like you in their ranks. All you need now is more training.",	"s_5cfd5571":"The Bothans are holding out on you?",	"s_5d126009":"[pause] Honestly?",	"s_5d2275e3":"And I'm playing defense?",	"s_5e57a2aa":"Well, thanks for everything, Brother Ezkiel.",	"s_5f5ad8b2":"You're dedicated.",	"s_5fec5259":"No craftier than the spy at that outpost.",	"s_61b6494b":"Am I that transparent? Oh dear. I would be a terrible diplomat, I'm afraid. You are correct.  A Bothan base is under attack by Nym's pirates. They are in trouble and need defenders. They are spies, not soldiers.",	"s_629b68ab":"It was going so well. We thought we were on the verge of learning the purpose of the Imperial Inquisition.",	"s_63e41":"About the Force. The Inquisitors have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of that knowledge. We have done the same. And now we have that informer's information.",	"s_68355d90":"We've uploaded general coordinates in the Endor system, but you'll have to find his exact location yourself, I'm afraid. Good luck. ",	"s_692e89db":"They do now, I'm afraid.",	"s_6a273da9":"I'm ready to go. Where is this leader's ship?",	"s_6a5142e8":"I don't know why you are talking to me when you have Imperials to kill!",	"s_6bdcb65c":"Just tell me where to go.",	"s_6dea91bd":"That mission was quite dangerous. Perhaps it's time to return to training. I want you to have the skills you need to succeed.",	"s_6e6f308b":"With the pilots? Yes he has. It makes me sick.",	"s_6e75fbb0":"The Vortex is in danger.",	"s_6eb747d4":"That's very kind of him.",	"s_74967449":"I thought that we could trust you, %TU... but it seems we were mistaken.",	"s_78":"Imperial ships are attacking a Rebel outpost - one that is very important to us.",	"s_7af82252":"Because I must. The informer's data is encrypted. Only the Bothans can translate it.",	"s_7d043357":"What's so special about it?",	"s_7d3deb6":"Secrets about the Force crystals?",	"s_7eab0dc3":"So even though he was an Imperial spy, he was carrying useful information after all!",	"s_80":"What's so special about it?",	"s_804150c5":"What's happened?",	"s_81f74c8a":"His data may explain everything about the cybernetic experiments and the Empire's interest in Force Crystals. Or it may be a recipe for chocolate cake. We don't know. It's encrypted.  We need the Bothans to translate it.",	"s_8287425f":"Well done. You gave those pirates a run for their money.",	"s_82cf4ca7":"Why is the Empire targeting this system? Is it because of you?",	"s_83":"Does the Empire know that?",	"s_840116ce":"Blast you! You haven't done your job!",	"s_840cb413":"It's not paranoia if they're really after you, %NU. ",	"s_841654d2":"That's great news!",	"s_841d27db":"Why?",	"s_85":"I don't know. I hope to find out. In the meantime, I need you to defend that outpost...",	"s_87":"Alright.",	"s_8874f806":"Then you know how crafty they can be. ",	"s_88e20a47":"They have found a way to fuse a pilot forcibly to his ship, turning him into a cybernetic slave.",	"s_89":"The attack is led by an Imperial Inquisitor. He is your primary target. Kill him, and the attacking forces will scatter. ",	"s_8a212117":"Sick.",	"s_8a226979":"I cannot help you.",	"s_8a4f7617":"Please.",	"s_8b1d3cb":"Is it? I don't know. The Empire will probably send more forces.",	"s_8cf5321":"The attack is led by an Imperial Inquisitor. He is your primary target. Kill him, and the attacking forces will scatter. ",	"s_91a4e21b":"And give safe passage to someone on the station.",	"s_92ecc2cf":"The Empire will do anything to gain the edge in this war.",	"s_930d070e":"The Empire is ambitious. They will continue to unleash their forces against us. They are extremely interested in what we know. And, of course, we are equally interested in what THEY know.",	"s_93c9d623":"What about Alliance forces?",	"s_94":"Imperial ships are attacking a Rebel outpost - one that is very important to us.",	"s_96":"What's so special about it?",	"s_96483773":"Oh no. Have no illusions, it will be difficult. But you will have the element of surprise.",	"s_97c42bb7":"Of course. That's how Bothans are. Nothing is free.",	"s_98":"It is a rendezvous point for the Vortex. It is, in many ways, our library. It holds our secrets.",	"s_98332b2a":"Anytime.",	"s_9865d5b5":"Destroy their leader ship. Without it, the pirate fleet will flounder - and that's exactly what the Bothans want.",	"s_991a471c":"Not yet. You'll be reporting to Brother Extok Evin from now on. He is on Talus. You can find him in the 'Green Room' of the theater in Dearic.",	"s_9a2a8f72":"A Bothan base is under attack by Nym's pirates. They are in trouble and need defenders. They are spies, not soldiers.",	"s_9ac7f904":"Am I leaving the Vortex?",	"s_9cc8e2ce":"I'm ready for another mission.",	"s_9d7c11a1":"Of course. I'm a soldier.",	"s_9e4cb685":"Excellent! They must reveal something about the Empire's plans.",	"s_9f3f2aef":"Know about what?",	"s_9f97864a":"There's more. You need to pick up someone on the station.",	"s_9feb4fa3":"Imperial forces are attacking a Rebel outpost - one that is very important to the Vortex.",	"s_a0e6a107":"I can still turn this around.",	"s_a1217b89":"Who? Another member of the Vortex?",	"s_a285e391":"%TU. Brother Vrovel says you can be trusted.",	"s_a2f15702":"Yes they do, and they enjoy their work - but I do not think that is their true purpose. ",	"s_a30c289b":"You'll understand when an Imperial tries to attach you to a ship - with a blowtorch. Unless that sounds good to you - get back out there!",	"s_a44e69af":"I see. Then we must seem like a silly group of old men to you.",	"s_a490d2c6":"Alright.",	"s_a63013e4":"It is a rendezvous point for the Vortex. It is, in many ways, our library. It holds our secrets.",	"s_a64028fc":"Why would the Empire force loyal soldiers into those kind of experiments?",	"s_a6792612":"And they won't help until we secure their base.",	"s_aa11d5d2":"You only need to kill their leader.",	"s_aa7a038e":"Talking to me - but you're leaving for the Dathomir system, as of now. Take out those Imperials!",	"s_aacbf366":"Are you ready to work? The Vortex needs good pilots, now more than ever.",	"s_ab272dee":"Not at all! I will miss you and your spirited attitude. You'll be reporting to Brother Extok Evin from now on. He is on Talus. You can find him in the 'Green Room' of the theater in Dearic.",	"s_abd40fb":"With you by their side, the Bothans see an opportunity to defeat these pirates once and for all.",	"s_b24e355f":"You'll find your coordinates in your ships computer. Take off for the Dathomir system immediately. Good luck.",	"s_b2aaabb1":"I don't need a reason to shoot Imperials!",	"s_b34ab6f6":"The Empire is DEFINITELY the enemy.",	"s_b552b5dd":"Not according to what I've been hearing.  You have aided the Empire against us.  We will not trust you with any more assignments until you prove yourself an ally of the Rebel Alliance.",	"s_b5be169d":"Not many people share your belief. We face opposition from within the Alliance, all the time.",	"s_b70082a7":"The Spynet's quite pleased. I think you've shut those pirates down, once and for all. This will help us in the future. Bothans are good friends to have.",	"s_b9b27823":"Thank you.",	"s_ba11bd82":"And?",	"s_ba42ea16":"You say that like it's easy.",	"s_ba5bf569":"I try.",	"s_bb3b47bf":"But first? It sounds like there's a problem.",	"s_bc380d91":"I'm not here to convince you. I'm here to order you to defend the base.",	"s_bc7aea36":"They're holding their own, but just barely.",	"s_be1e6832":"Immediately, I'm afraid. I'm sorry to see you go. It's been a pleasure working with you. ",	"s_c1e154f":"Sick - but efficient. These cybernetic pilots never question orders, and they never sleep, never eat.",	"s_c20e6f2b":"Ah, but it's not so simple. The Bothans have made a small request.",	"s_c3fb9152":"I appreciate that. Because we can use your help. The Empire is preparing to attack our outpost. We are in desperate need of your help.",	"s_c5c397c9":"Danger lurks around every corner. We cannot be sure who is friend and who is foe.",	"s_c5c41a6":"No. Are these pilots flying for the Empire?",	"s_c5fd31d9":"You're right. First we must help the Bothans.",	"s_c872184":"I know you will. Now please hurry. There's not much time.",	"s_c9e0d4f1":"If you would.",	"s_c9f02e02":"Go! You must succeed.",	"s_cb3876f5":"Immediately. Coordinates are already in your ship database. Thank you for your help.",	"s_cbc2d68c":"Your work here is done %TU. ",	"s_cd53d6a8":"But do they know it's a Vortex outpost?",	"s_cd650ee8":"The Empire is everywhere.",	"s_cdcbf519":"What do YOU want?",	"s_ceaea132":"You can trust me",	"s_d001ebec":"We've attracted the attention of the Inquisition.",	"s_d15e12a8":"We want information. They want secrets. There is a difference. ",	"s_d178b596":"That doesn't prove anything! The Empire attacks everything it sees.",	"s_d2bd9636":"Not standing here, you can't. Please return to your ship.",	"s_d3b66245":"I think the Force exists.",	"s_d3cb3651":"It's evil, but not impossible. We must know more. And we need that outpost secured!",	"s_d40fde1":"Anytime, you say? Well, how about right now? They'd like to enlist your services again.",	"s_d41d97bf":"Things are coming to a head in this system. Imperial forces are launching a major assault.",	"s_d55f2579":"I'm ready to go.",	"s_d561a496":"I will do my best.",	"s_d57982dc":"Yes. They're horrible.",	"s_d5ad9570":"The less said about him, the better.",	"s_d5f9f79b":"But only if I do my job.",	"s_d611f5ae":"All's fair in love and war. ",	"s_d683dc69":"I hope not. Now please hurry. There's not much time.",	"s_d70dba34":"Yes.",	"s_d764414f":"Hate is a tool of the Dark Side. I must learn to control my feelings. It is not easy.",	"s_d786a9a7":"Nothing is more important than those Force crystals. Now you must help us, and quickly.",	"s_d7eb327a":"There's no word for what they're doing. You must defend that outpost. We need that information.",	"s_d88c653e":"Are you sure?",	"s_da08554e":"But the pirate fleet is huge! I can't kill them all.",	"s_deccbb06":"Who? A member of the Vortex?",	"s_ded27301":"I'm not defeated yet!",	"s_e2e9a78f":"It would seem so. We've always been very private about our activities there. I do not know how they found out about us.",	"s_e494ecca":"Then what am I doing here on the ground?",	"s_e5e9b349":"The Bothans want those pirates destroyed, once and for all. And you can help them.",	"s_e5f0e762":"We have the opportunity to learn more about the Inquisition's activities. We have found an Imperial aide, someone who possesses a great deal of knowledge about the experiments and the Force Crystals. He is willing to tell us what he knows. ",	"s_e711b5e8":"Maddening creatures.",	"s_e7150ae1":"That's not possible.",	"s_e77894ce":"I hope they ARE machines - for their sake. Can you imagine being trapped in your own body like that?",	"s_e9c7f196":"We've uploaded the coordinates to your database. Be warned, an Imperial Inquisitor is leading the attack. He is your primary target.",	"s_ea78d92a":"Do you need a translation? Bothans are master translators.",	"s_eb3c17f0":"Was it something I said?",	"s_eb5863d5":"You're awfully quick to help Bothans. I thought you hated them.",	"s_eba35f17":"When do I leave?",	"s_ebd3969d":"No man should die that way. There is no end to the darkness in the heart of the Emperor. If he finds a way to harness the power of the Force, then our future will be bleak indeed.",	"s_ed8cbd3f":"So they're just killing machines.",	"s_eeb2051f":"Very nice work, %TU. Are you ready for further training?",	"s_ef42359f":"I want information on those Force crystals. And the Bothans are going to give it to me!",	"s_f0300e70":"Yes. Well unfortunately things have become more complicated. Have you ever dealt with Bothans before?",	"s_f4fff1e0":"No offense.",	"s_f68ef5df":"Yes, they are. Now you see why we need their help. But it's quid pro quo. First, WE must help THEM.",	"s_f8438ea7":"A pilot as good as you are, you deserve the best training possible. I can help. ",	"s_f845f64a":"They're a lot like you. They always want information.",	"s_f8a22f8":"Immediately. Coordinates are already in your ship database.",	"s_f92771aa":"Not yet. But they will be, soon. And Imperial forces are launching a huge attack now, to soften the ground.",	"s_fb1d4add":"Not exactly. Now please hurry. There's not much time.",	"s_fc9a12c0":"I'm ready to go. Just point the way.",	"s_fca1dce9":"I've seen a lot of strange things out here. Anything's possible. That's what I think.",	"s_fcf4d778":"How?",	"s_fd120cac":"Vrovel told me a bit about the Vortex - about what you do.",	"s_fd2e11b9":"I don't see how this helps the Alliance!",	"s_fdba7430":"You can count on me.",	"s_fffd9426":"The Bothans have delivered their translations, as promised."
