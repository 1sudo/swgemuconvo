If so, I need your help. They took my best racing durnis. All three of them. Do you know how hard it is to train a racing durni? Well, to be honest, it's not really all that difficult. But still, those were mine! I spent years training them. Could you get them back for me?",	"s_44":"I'll be glad to help.",	"s_45":"No, I don't think so.",	"s_46":"Thank you. They'll be in small cages. Hopefully, they haven't been harmed.",	"s_47":"I understand. I should not have asked.",	"s_48":"You found them! Oh, it's so good to have them back. Don't worry, guys, we'll start training again right away!",	"s_49":"They'll be in small cages somewhere in the bunker."
