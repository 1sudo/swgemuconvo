		"s_ff20b1f1":"Yes, please reset my employment history.",		"s_f7565bbd":"YES, I am sure. I want to continue my service.",		"s_f51b07ff":"What kind of questions?",		"s_f2538a47":"Very well, it is done.

Please come back and see me again if you change your mind.",		"s_e3c4a3d5":"No, do not reset my history. I will continue my service.",		"s_ce56f943":"If I reset your history, you will be able to go back and assist the Empire again as you have done in the past.

What do you need?",		"s_b193a14c":"Alright, but keep in mind that once I reset your history, it cannot be undone. Are you sure that you want me to reset your employment history?",		"s_ac97bdc2":"If you like, I can reset your employment history and you can begin your service again.

Please come back and speak with me when you get a free moment.",		"s_2380d732":"If you choose to continue from where you left off, you will simply return to the person which last gave you a job.
