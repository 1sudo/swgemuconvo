It's so bad that you can't travel without a shuttle or a blaster rifle.  And my son has neither and is coming to visit soon.  I'm afraid for him.",	"s_115":"I'd be happy to clear the way.",	"s_117":"Thank you!  First thing, I need you to go thin out the worrt population.  Come back when you are done.",	"s_119":"I'm not interested",	"s_121":"I wish you would reconsider.  If you do, come back and talk to me.",	"s_123":"It isn't that bad!  I think the city is quite clean.",	"s_125":"No no, not the city.  I'm talking about the wilderness.  If you live in a major city it's all right.  But if there's no shuttle port, traveling here is just dangerous.   And my son has neither and is coming to visit soon.  I'm afraid for him",	"s_127":"I'd be happy to help you make the area safer.",	"s_129":"Great!  First thing, I need you to go thin out the worrt population.  Come back when you are done.",	"s_131":"I'm not interested.",	"s_134":"I wish you would reconsider.  If you do, please come back and talk to me.",	"s_138":"Nasty?  Only if you are too weak to protect yourself.",	"s_142":"You think so?  If you are so tough, I have a job for you then.  I want some of the dangerous creatures cleared out.  You strong enough for that?",	"s_146":"Why not?  I could use the credits.",	"s_150":"Great!  First thing, I need you to go thin out the worrt population.  Come back when you are done.",	"s_154":"Nah.  Sounds too boring.",	"s_158":"Guess you aren't as tough as you say you are.  If you change your mind, I'll be here.",	"s_162":"How are you doing with the worrts? ",	"s_166":"I'm done.",	"s_170":"Excellent!  Thanks for taking care of that.  I transferred some credits into your bank account.  Come back and talk to me when you are ready for another job.",	"s_174":"I'm not finished yet.",	"s_178":"Well, I believe in you.  You can do it!",	"s_182":"Welcome back.  I have another assignment if you are willing.",	"s_186":"Sure.  I'm always ready for a good fight.",	"s_190":"There's an infestation of rills.  Please go kill 10 of them.",	"s_194":"Sorry, I'm too busy right now.",	"s_198":"Fine.  Come back when you have more free time.",	"s_202":"How are you doing with the rills?",	"s_206":"I'm not quite done yet.",	"s_210":"Come back to me when you finish.",	"s_214":"I finished what you wanted.",	"s_218":"Fantastic!  I transferred a few credits to your account to offset your operating costs. Now,  I'm tracking down some information.  I'll have it in a moment or two if you don't mind waiting.  ",	"s_222":"Hello again!  Now that I know that you are an accomplished hunter, I can tell you about something that is far more serious and dangerous than the pests near the city.",	"s_226":"What do you mean?",	"s_230":"About a week ago, a particularly nasty gang of thugs ambushed a caravan of people who were moving to the city.  There were... no survivors.",	"s_233":"That's terrible!",	"s_236":"Yes.  While I know that getting the families' lost possessions back will not make up for the loss of their loved ones, at least it will help with their debts, and maybe give them something to remember their children by.",	"s_238":"I will get the possessions back, if you want me to.",	"s_241":"Thank you.  I know that they will appreciate this.",	"s_244":"I'd rather not deal with this.",	"s_246":"I thought better of you. But when you are done being afraid, come back to me.",	"s_249":"And how does this affect me?",	"s_252":"I want you to go after these bandits and get back what they stole.",	"s_254":"Sure.  A little revenge is great with caf in the morning.",	"s_257":"Thank you.  I'll see you when you get back.",	"s_260":"Not now.  I'm tired.  I'll go after them tomorrow.",	"s_262":"I thought better of you.  But if you must wait, then come back when you are ready.",	"s_265":"Good.  I want to go after tougher prey.  Tell me more.",	"s_268":"Have you found everything yet?",	"s_270":"Not yet.",	"s_273":"Ok.  I'm clearing some space in my transport for when you are done.",	"s_276":"Yes.  Here they are.",	"s_280":"This will be such a great help to them.  Thank you very much.  You deserve more, but this is all that I have for now.",	"s_284":"Actually, I'm lost.  Can you give me that waypoint again?",	"s_288":"Sure.  I'll copy that to you now.",	"s_292":"Well, you seem to have stirred up a flewt nest!",	"s_296":"What do you mean?",	"s_300":"It looks like those bandits didn't take too kindly to your attack.  I hear that they started reappearing en force.",	"s_304":"Hmm... guess I should encourage them to go back to hiding.",	"s_308":"I think that their leader is the one that you really want.  Unfortunately, the leaders tend to be hard to find.  I'll bet one of those guys out there has some information that will lead you to the leader.  When you find it come back to me. ",	"s_312":"I don't really think I need to concern myself with them any more.",	"s_316":"If you are now one of their targets, I don't think they will leave you alone.  If you change your mind, come back to me.",	"s_320":"So?",	"s_324":"Looks like you are now one of the bandits' targets.  If you don't want to have to watch your back every second, you should probably go do something about them.",	"s_328":"I tend to watch my back anyway, but you're right.  I'll go take care of them.",	"s_332":"I'll bet if you take out their leader, they will scatter.  I don't know where their leader is though.  I'll bet one of the bandits has some kind of information about their main camp on them.  Here's the latest information about their activity.",	"s_336":"I have had enough of this.  I'm done!  No more brigands!",	"s_340":"For some reason I don't think they will respect your wishes.  But if you want to ignore them, it's your funeral.  Come back if you change your mind.",	"s_342":"How did it go?",	"s_344":"I haven't found anything yet.",	"s_346":"There has to be something.  Good luck!",	"s_348":"Looks like this datapad has something useful.",	"s_350":"Great!  Let me take a look at it... give me a moment.",	"s_352":"I need the location again.",	"s_354":"All right.  I'm copying the data to you now.",	"s_356":"Welcome back.  Ready to squish a bug?",	"s_358":"If you mean hunting down the brigand leader, then yes.",	"s_360":"That's exactly what I mean.  Here is the location of the camp.",	"s_362":"Yep.  Less competition for me...I mean, yes, of course.",	"s_364":"Hm...less competition?  Well, if you leave innocent travelers alone, that's your life.  I just want this thug eliminated.",	"s_366":"I have been hearing rumors, but nothing confirmed.  How is it going?",	"s_368":"The leader was tough, but not impossible.",	"s_370":"I'm glad the area is safe for travelers now.  Too many people died because of them.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  Take this.",	"s_372":"They messed with the wrong person",	"s_374":"They did indeed, and I put my trust in the right one.  Too many good people died because of them.  Take this as thanks for the great service you did.",	"s_376":"I took care of the leader.  I'm surprised that they were able to do as much damage as they did.",	"s_378":"Yes, well...I guess their leader was better at organizing than fighting.  Many good people died because of him.",	"s_380":"Not anymore.",	"s_382":"No.  Not anymore.  You have certainly earned your reward. I already transferred 2000 credits into your bank account and this should help you in your travels.",	"s_384":"I'm sure they did.  Now, about my reward?",	"s_386":"I already transferred 2000 credits into your bank account.  I also have this for you.  You did me a favor and I thank you for it.  But after this, I don't want to talk to you again. ",	"s_388":"I haven't gotten to the leader yet.",	"s_390":"I guess the rumors were optimistic.  No matter, come back when you are done.",	"s_392":"Actually, I need the location again.",	"s_394":"It's a good thing I keep copies!  Here you are.",	"s_396":"Thanks again for all your help."
