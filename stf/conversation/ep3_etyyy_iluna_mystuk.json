I think a Zabrak with that name went to the Arcona compound to the west. You should go there and ask the Arcona about him.",	"s_1779":"Thank you. Farewell.",	"s_1781":"And farewell to you also.",	"s_1783":"[Show Greyclimber's Eye to Iluna]",	"s_1785":"It's good that you came to me instead of Sordaan. He has an odd soft spot for the Kashyyyk bantha and does not allow anyone to hunt them. Nonetheless, this is an impressive kill. I note that you've also hunted and killed Brightclaw, Paleclaw, Spiketop, Stoneleg, and Silkthrower. Very impressive, indeed. Sordaan should know of your hunting prowess. I'll not mention that Greyclimber was a Kashyyyk bantha, though.",	"s_1787":"I'll go speak with Sordaan",	"s_1789":"Good. Go on then.",	"s_1791":"It's good that you came to me instead of Sordaan.
