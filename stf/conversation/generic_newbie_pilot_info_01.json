		"s_fe631380":"Good luck, my friend!",		"s_fd5402d8":"Ah! Then it should give you information about where to go to start your naval adventure. Good luck, my friend!",		"s_fae2eb08":"You don't have the space expansion.",		"s_fa94d5c5":"Good-bye!",		"s_fa2e7213":"No problem!",		"s_f90ad503":"I see. Thanks!",		"s_f2a4df5e":"Good idea! Thanks.",		"s_ee65526d":"Have a good day!",		"s_eab69714":"Strange. Seems that if they undertook the risk to send you a message, they would make it clear how to respond. Why don't you check your email a little closer.",		"s_e9934b03":"Use the command CTRL+V to open the planet map. On the right side of your display you will see a listing of trainers by category. All local trainers who register with the planet will appear on this list. Click the 'Trainer' tab and then look for a pilot trainer.",		"s_cf5fc0f":"How do I repair my starship?",		"s_cdd2fccc":"That's sort of tricky. There may be some Alliance pilots bold enough to register their locations on the planetary map. Have you looked at the planet map yet?",		"s_cdb17e79":"How do I check the planetary map?",		"s_cb747ceb":"Hmm. Me neither. Maybe you should give it a little time?",		"s_c9e97ed5":"How else would I join up?",		"s_c7f2987a":"Your best bet is to get in touch with the Empire and sign up for their training program. Of course... there are others who will urge you to put your efforts to use in the Alliance. What interests you?",		"s_c4682ea6":"Thanks!",		"s_c2db6878":"Good-bye.",		"s_bc324892":"Don't mention it!",		"s_bb38db80":"Interesting. Well... good luck with that. I don't want to get too close to the galactic civil war, myself.",		"s_ba3c26af":"You did? These are desperate times, indeed. The email should probably indicate where you are supposed to go for initial recruitment.",		"s_b9b27823":"Thank you.",		"s_b641cda6":"Where can I find a bazaar terminal?",		"s_add31f19":"I need a starship.",		"s_acc368b1":"How do I join the Empire?",		"s_ab00aa08":"Bazaar terminals are located all over major cities. Check the areas surrounding major hot-spots like the starport, the bank, any of the cantinas, or even the hospitals.",		"s_a9850aec":"I got an email from the Alliance!",		"s_a2737181":"That's what I've heard. I can understand how the Empire does it. They're pretty well-equipped! But there are rumors that the Alliance has also prepared a fleet of ships so they can get new recruits into the fray as soon as possible.",		"s_97a37895":"Have you checked the bazaar terminals? Shipwrights from all over the area put finished starships up for sale on the local bazaar.",		"s_94e18e61":"Oh! Hello there. I just got back from a rather dangerous trip through the star system. It sure feels good to be back on solid ground. What can I do for you?",		"s_93280d8a":"Good idea. Thanks!",		"s_8b70941b":"You are a Privateer pilot. You don't need my help.",		"s_8b37a99a":"How do I make money?",		"s_8b23fac":"I want to learn to fly.",		"s_8515e448":"Yes. I have an email from the Imperial Navy.",		"s_847df52f":"Don't mention it.",		"s_728131b6":"That's a shame. It seems like most systems have fallen on hard economic times because of the war. Most of the pilots are flying for either the Empire or the Rebellion, now. Too few free pilots for my taste. Ever think of joining the military to get a starship?",		"s_6f0ab63b":"Stay safe, my friend.",		"s_5ebe92b8":"I think that the majority of pilot trainers are registered with the planetary map. Try opening the planet map with CTRL+V. On the right-hand-side there is a listing of categories. Look under 'trainer' to find any local pilot teacher who's looking for pupils.",		"s_5e410744":"Right-click on the map location to create and activate a waypoint. Follow the waypoint to the trainer's location.",		"s_5b893f7c":"It does.",		"s_5a1d315c":"On the lower right-side of your screen there should be a 'letter' icon that is flashing. Double-click on this icon and it will bring up your personal email. Read over the subject and sender, and scroll through the body text to get all the details.",		"s_598fb819":"You are a Rebel pilot. You don't need my help.",		"s_5989c487":"There are all sorts of civilian contracts available on the 'mission terminals' you find throughout town. Look for them near any major structure. Use the terminal to bring up the current list of local contracts. Choose the one that interests you most and you'll make money when the task is complete.",		"s_5618d2cd":"No. I have received no email.",		"s_558a361a":"The Imperial Navy? I've heard that they are sending out recruitment emails to everyone they can locate these days. Have you checked your email today?",		"s_52939a0":"How do I check my email?",		"s_42ddcfd5":"Local space stations are the easiest way to get your ship repaired. When you are heading back here, you should stop at the space station and ask them for repairs. They will provide a quick estimate on what it will take to get you back on-track.",		"s_3ece5721":"No problem! Take care!",		"s_32146025":"Then what?",		"s_3059f369":"What then?",		"s_2e30f02b":"Look for the flashing 'envelope' icon on your interface. It's placed on the lower right-hand-side of your screen by default.",		"s_29894b97":"I don't know how to check.",		"s_2941e8d8":"Double-click on the envelope icon, and read your mail!",		"s_27186cee":"I don't have enough money.",		"s_270c87b2":"How do I get them to repair my ship?",		"s_250fded0":"I know you. What can I do for you?",		"s_21bf1a8c":"How do I join the Alliance?",		"s_1d489448":"You are an Imperial pilot. You don't need my help.",		"s_1a06c1df":"It doesn't.",		"s_17bc5d9b":"When you approach the space station, use SHIFT+C to target it and open communication with the commander. You will be asked if you want to purchase repairs or if you want to land on the planet.",		"s_144ec5cc":"Sounds good. Thanks!",		"s_12157feb":"The military gives out free ships?",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (generic_newbie_pilot_info_01.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
