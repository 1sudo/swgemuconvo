		"s_e0574420":"My master says I can't talk to you because you're not a pilot. Please forgive me.",		"s_db040e63":"I'm so glad you've returned. You didn't forget about me! Did you find anything up there? If you did, you can just drag it on me. I will pay you for each. My master will be so happy!",		"s_da79c836":"Weird. How did he become your master?",		"s_d6695e83":"No thanks.",		"s_cbf9648e":"Oh yeah. Sorry. I can get so talkative sometimes. My master doesn't like it so much. The task... My master needs information from the.. uh, space systems, I guess it is? I'm not really too smart about those beyond the ground. Anyway, the information can be 'a log', or 'a diary', or anything like that. If you find them, just give them to me. My master trusts me when it comes in his money. I can give you some for the information you bring us.",		"s_ca583977":"Endor... I've never been there before either. I really need to travel one of these days. It's one of my dreams.. Oh well. Thank you for this.",		"s_c28b61a1":"I'm so happy! Please come back as soon as you can. I always get a good behavior treat when I do well for my master.",		"s_b73ef16b":"Sounds good. I'll do it.",		"s_a5a29e5e":"I hope he treats you nicely.",		"s_a27729d9":"Interesting. What task did you want me to do?",		"s_a1368bc4":"Oh yeah. Sorry. The task... My master needs information from the.. uh, space systems, I guess it is? I'm not really too smart about those beyond the ground. Anyway, the information can be 'a log', or 'a diary', or anything like that. If you find them, just give them to me. My master trusts me when it comes in his money. I can give you some for the information you bring us.",		"s_a128c839":"Thank you for the information. My master will be most happy!",		"s_9f7731a8":"Wow! Dathomir! I've heard so many things about the nasty Imperials and their prison on that planet--oh, I better be quiet, my master says. There are a lot of Imperial friends around here.",		"s_9c4a22e":"Thanks. About this task you mentioned...",		"s_95de3587":"You're the best %TO! This is great information for my master.",		"s_914ec8cb":"Oh, he does. You're such a nice %TO.",		"s_8aa2d689":"Well, I was orphaned at a very young age and was found by a slave smuggler. He sold me to a Chadra-Fan whom took me to his homeworld on Chad. I met my master, Peraw, soon afterward and he taught me the Chadra-Fan language. I'm a loyal servant who happens to know Basic as well.",		"s_7c4f443":"I've been to Corellia a couple of times. It's kinda depressing, though. The colors are too grey. Oh--thank you for the information. Here's your pay.",		"s_6acea54":"Naboo.. I hear it's such a nice, pleasant place. I want to go there one day, but my master won't let me yet. He's very protective. Thank you for this.",		"s_60682af":"Tatoo--Tatooine! That's where we are now! Sorry, I'm just learning how to read. My master will be very happy with this.",		"s_5fea04c":"My master says I can speak with you. You seem to be a pilot and we--or at least, he--could use your help with a small task. If you don't say yes, my master will be very angry at me.",		"s_579e662c":"Uh.. no thanks. I'll be going now.",		"s_4dcc9c02":"My master is a Chadra-Fan. He does kinda look like a mouse, doesn't he? We came to Mos Eisley because Chadra-Fan are very afraid of drowning. Since there's no water here on Tatooine, it really isn't a problem for him.",		"s_4cf73d47":"Okay. What about this task?",		"s_3e114acc":"That mouse thing is your master?",		"s_3a570abb":"I'm going to get into so much trouble.",		"s_39ab0bf8":"I don't know where this is from, but it seems interesting. Thank you, kind %TO.",		"s_249fa88e":"Oh no!",		"s_1938855f":"I don't know anything about Lok. I wonder what it's like. Maybe I'll go there one day. Oh--sorry. Thank you for this. Here's your pay.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (story_loot_eisley.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
