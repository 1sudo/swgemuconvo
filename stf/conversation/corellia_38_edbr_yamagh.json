Let me know if I can be of further assistance.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"I'm speechless. I would never in a million, billion years have suspected the Lt. Col. capable of something like this. It would appear that working for him was much less of an honor than I once thought.",	"s_32":"Any luck finding the medal yet?",	"s_34":"You're here about Lt. Col. Quelsh's missing medal?",	"s_36":"Yes, that's right. Can you tell me what happened?",	"s_38":"I wish I knew. He wears it practically every day. I can't imagine when someone could have stolen it. But I must admit that I've searched everywhere I could think of, and yet I've found no sign of it. Now that I think about it, there is one thing that might mean something.",	"s_43":"Working for Lt. Col. Quelsh is an honor that I would be hesitant to relinquish.",	"s_44":"What's that?",	"s_45":"I noticed some thugs hanging around the area recently. I think they call themselves Braggan's Fist. Whatever that means. They are often loitering around in the slums area. You might want to see if they were involved."
