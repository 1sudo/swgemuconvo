A local businessman made a sudden turnaround from almost bankrupt to high rolling success almost overnight. Could be he sold out to the Chirq Council.",	"s_2":"",	"s_37":"Thanks for diverting attention away from me. Still though, if they are rumors circulating about me being CorSec among criminal circles, maybe it's time for me to move on.",	"s_39":"Keep moving. It's not good for us to be seen talking. Especially right now.",	"s_41":"We can't be seen talking. It's too dangerous to both of us.",	"s_43":"Hey, this is my turf. Move somewhere else.",	"s_44":"Good luck with you infiltration of the Chirq Council. I know firsthand how tricky undercover work can be.",	"s_46":"Gwirrye Baric is a good bet to know something about the Chirq Council. He operates alone, so I seriously doubt he works for them, but he's much smarter than he lets on and is bound to know something.",	"s_47":"Once those Ragtags are off of my case, I'll have more freedom to gather information for CorSec.",	"s_48":"We need to make this quick. It will look unusual if we're seen together for too long. I'm still gathering the intel you need, but in the meantime, I need a favor. Some local Ragtags have been harassing me and seem suspicious. I need them to be removed without drawing attention to me.",	"s_49":"I'll take care of those Ragtags.",	"s_50":"Thank you. While you do that, I'll finish getting the intel you need.",	"s_51":"I know, but you are in danger. Keep a low profile for a while.",	"s_52":"Thanks for the warning. It'll be odd if I disappear from the streets, so I need to stay visible. But I'll halt my investigation for now."
