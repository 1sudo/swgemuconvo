Go on, I don't have all day to wait.",	"s_2":"",	"s_29":"Calm down, Meatlump. I'm sure your brothers will be along soon. For your sake, you should hope so anyway. I'm getting paid either way.",	"s_30":"Not bad. Not bad at all. You handle yourself well. The Bofa Treat Gang never stood a chance.",	"s_31":"The pleasure was all mine.",	"s_32":"Tell you what. I have three bounties on Lok I haven't had a chance to collect. You take care of them for me, and I'll split the bounty with you. An associate of mine, named Balfur, has been tracking them. Speak with him for more details. He should still be in his camp outside of Nym's Stronghold on Lok.",	"s_33":"What do you want me to do?",	"s_35":"The bounty on Louis, as well as his brothers, was placed by a man named Lucien. He leads the Bofa Treat Gang who use this bunker here as their hideout. What Lucien apparently does not realize is that there is a much larger bounty on him. I would prefer that larger bounty. You take care of Lucien and his gang, and I'll let Louis go.",	"s_37":"If you're too afraid to take on the Bofa Treat Gang, say so now. Either Louis' brothers will have to make an appearance, or I'll just collect his bounty.",	"s_8":"Who are you? Oh, you're here for Louis? I suppose that can work. We'll find out soon enough. I have Louis here as my prisoner. If you do what I ask, I'll let him go."
