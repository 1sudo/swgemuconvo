Would you like to learn about exciting opportunities for pilots in the Imperial Navy?",		"s_f4792d0c":"Good hunting!",		"s_f202ee89":"I can't tell you anything. It's highly classified. However, I can add the location of the unit's pilot trainer to your datapad.  You may speak to him in the main plaza association hall in Kaadara, on Naboo. Use the travel terminal here to reach Naboo. Choose the Kaadara starport as your landing site.",		"s_ee369d68":"What can you tell me about Black Epsilon?",		"s_ed23ffff":"Are you interested in either Black Epsilon or the Storm Squadron, sir?",		"s_e671e2ef":"You don't look like much of a pilot to me. You're not what we call, 'properly equipped', if you know what I mean.",		"s_e0db13e8":"Storm Squadron is one of the Empire's finest military units, in space or otherwise.  They're the very model of the sort of hard-core, dedicated, soldiers that secure the Empire throughout the galaxy.",		"s_df2917b1":"Tell me more",		"s_d78c7ec0":"Ma'am!  Yes, ma'am!

Black Epsilon is stationed at the Imperial Base on Talus, as Corellia itself is officially neutral... for now.  There are reports of considerable Rebel activity in the area, as you can imagine.  They could really use more pilots there, ma'am.",		"s_b945b46a":"Yes, ma'am.  I can't release any specific details about their current engagements, but I will add the location of their own recruiter to your datapad.
