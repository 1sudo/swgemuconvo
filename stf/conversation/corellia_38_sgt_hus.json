I have to figure out a way to get the goods they've stolen back to their rightful owners. Hey, maybe you can help. Would you go into that camp and recover the stolen goods for me?",	"s_44":"I'll be glad to help.",	"s_45":"No, I don't think so.",	"s_46":"Thank you.",	"s_47":"Ah, well, it's just as well. I should be doing my own work rather than fostering it off on someone else.",	"s_48":"You got all the stolen goods. Great. When my superiors hear about how I broke this case, I'm sure to get that promotion. No more bookkeeping for me! Oh, and I'll mention your part. Really I will.",	"s_49":"In the camp just beyond us are some crates of stolen goods. Go get those for me."
