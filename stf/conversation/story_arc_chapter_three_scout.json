Alright, let's go. And remember: keep them from destroying that generator.",	"s_15":"The droids are massing up ahead. They look like they are getting ready to make a strike at the facility, but they are being held up in the pass. A few of the boys got some weapons and are doing their best to slow their advance. We even managed to install a shield generator. I would bet everything that the droids are going to strike there first.",	"s_17":"So what do you need me to do?",	"s_19":"Get in there and help our boys guard that shield generator. If that goes down, there isn't a whole lot that stands between the droids and us.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"Nope.",	"s_22":"Yeah, it is a battleground in there.",	"s_23":"Ok, I am ready to face them down.",	"s_25":"Good. Those droids mean business, so watch your back and keep that shield generator safe. Let's move.",	"s_27":"Maybe I should go get some help?",	"s_32":"Yeah, why don't you do that. But remember, our boys cannot slow them down for very much longer.",	"s_34":"Shhhh. I am on a very important mission and can't be disturbed. If you are looking to help out, why don't you go talk to someone back at the facility? We probably could use the hand.",	"s_7":"You want to head back in?",	"s_9":"Yes."
