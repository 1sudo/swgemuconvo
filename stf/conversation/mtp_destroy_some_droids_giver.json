The lower maintenance areas are full of droids, but there are also security droids in the area. The droids must be destroyed, but we can't risk harming the security ones. Are you up to it?",	"s_13":"I am.",	"s_15":"Oh good. You'll have to be fast though. You'll only have about ten minutes once you're down there before the security droids get too suspicious. And be sure not to harm any of the security droids or they will raise the alarm.",	"s_17":"No thanks.",	"s_19":"Couldn't manage it? Don't worry. Not many Meatlumps can manage it. Let me know if you want to try again.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"I understand. If you're looking for something else to do, you could try making people laugh. That's pretty safe.",	"s_4":"You got rid of all those droids? What a relief! Thank you!!",	"s_7":"Go get rid of those droids. The lower levels are full of them. But don't harm the security droids.",	"s_9":"It's not yet safe to go back and get rid of more droids. The security droids are too thick right now. Maybe later."
