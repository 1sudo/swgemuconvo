You will help me, right?",	"s_12":"What kind of research?",	"s_14":"Captain Thrawn and I have recently come to this station in pursuit of...never mind why we are here. The fact is we are here and Captain Thrawn wants to make sure that things are in order. We need someone to listen to the local gossip and tell me what is going on around here.",	"s_16":"So, he needs a station spy?",	"s_18":"I assume that you return to me with information?",	"s_19":"Yes, I overheard something about a cloaked figure that has been questioning passengers.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"I am not done yet.",	"s_21":"Oh...I see. It's probably nothing, but you should tell Captain Thrawn who said that.",	"s_22":"Then do not bother me. I am very important, you understand.",	"s_23":"You have been helpful, but I have too much to do to talk.",	"s_24":"Bite your tongue! Trying to discover if someone is planning to riot is hardly spying. It's self-preservation.",	"s_26":"I'll do it!",	"s_28":"No way. I can't do something so intrusive.",	"s_30":"I would be happy to help.",	"s_32":"Good. I knew that I could count on you, %TU. Go to the Cantina and perform there.

But it is your choice.",	"s_38":"Of course I will help you.",	"s_40":"I can't right now, I'm busy.",	"s_42":"Very well. So am I. Go away.",	"s_43":"Certainly.",	"s_44":"Very good. See you when you are done."
