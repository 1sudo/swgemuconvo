Step away, please, I have official Imperial business to conduct.",	"s_106":"There are three basic types in the galaxy: those of the Empire, those of the Rebellion, and everyone else. We of the Empire accomplish everything, the Rebels oppose everything, and the rest just get in the way.",	"s_11":"What news have you? Did you obtain the droid AI?",	"s_15":"Did you find the droid AI? Consider your actions and aid your Empire. It is your only choice. I ask again, did you find the droid AI?",	"s_2":"",	"s_22":"When you find the droid AI, remember your duty to the Empire. You may yet be able to redeem yourself within the eyes and heart of the Empire.",	"s_24":"The droid AI was split and is housed in four different droids? How very odd. I will never understand the scientific mind. This complicates things slightly, but changes nothing. Gather all four parts of the AI and return with them to me. Be careful with whom you speak about this. I am watching.",	"s_26":"After gaining access to the RSF mainframe, use it to learn everything you can about the droid AI and where to find it. Then go and obtain it.",	"s_27":"You disappoint me gravely. That you should show such disloyalty to the Empire marks this as a saddened and diminished galaxy. And yet, perhaps there will come another chance for you to reclaim your place within the Empire. I hope, for your sake, you do not pass on such a chance.",	"s_28":"You, sir, are a credit to the Empire and to everything for which the Empire stands. Your actions have lead to a new hope of peace and prosperity for the entire galaxy. Except for those who stand against us, of course.",	"s_55":"Yes, I did.",	"s_56":"All four parts?",	"s_57":"Yes, all of it.",	"s_58":"I am impressed. Truly. I had my doubts about you, but Commander Barrezz assured me that you were the right choice. I am gratified to learn that he was correct. Now, if you please, surrender the AI to my care. I must get it to our scientists and droid engineers with extreme haste.",	"s_59":"[hand over the droid AI]",	"s_60":"No, I need to think about this a bit more.",	"s_61":"I must prepare at once for my departure. You are a hero of the Empire and a shining beacon for all those who desire peace and harmony in the galaxy. It has been an honor for you to serve with me. I'm sure you agree.",	"s_62":"There is nothing to think about. Your duty is to the Empire as is the duty of all. Do not tarnish this victory by tainting your loyalty to the Empire. Think quickly and then yield the AI to me.",	"s_63":"Yes, I have it.",	"s_64":"That is none of your concern.",	"s_65":"Oh, but it is. It very much concerns me. But I have yet to lose patience with you. When you have the droid AI, I have confidence you will relinquish it to me as is your rightful obligation.",	"s_66":"You have progressed farther than I actually expected you would. The Empire could use the services of someone like yourself. A good beginning and show of loyalty would be to surrender the AI to my care.",	"s_72":"Carry on with what you are doing, but consider carefully what you do with anything you find in that bunker. The Empire is generous to those who aid it, but merciless to those who stand in our way. Do not forget that.",	"s_74":"Search the old war bunker on the beach here near Kaadara. Imperial Intelligence suggests that some local criminals known as Skaak Tippers may have taken residence in the bunker, so be prepared. Examine anything of interest you find in the bunker.",	"s_76":"You dare flaunt your association with the Rebel Alliance in the face of an Imperial officer? Yes, I know about that. Of course I do. I am with the Empire and we know more about your actions that you should be comfortable with. Now then, let us discuss what you can do to regain our good graces.",	"s_78":"Yes, please. How may I redeem myself?",	"s_80":"Quite simple, actually. Obtain the droid AI we seek and all will be forgiven.",	"s_82":"How do I do that?",	"s_84":"No, thank you. I'm not interested.",	"s_86":"I'll humor you for now, but the patience of the Empire is not infinite. We will have that droid AI with your help or without it.",	"s_88":"Are you the one sent from Tatooine by Commander Adrian Barrezz?",	"s_90":"Yes, I am.",	"s_92":"Then we have no time to waste. You have conducted yourself well enough thus far, but this matter is far from over. You must procure the droid AI we seek.",	"s_94":"Where do I find the droid AI?",	"s_96":"Our next best guess based on the information you obtained from the small droid on Tatooine hints at an old war bunker near here. Go to that war bunker and search it for any technology you can find.",	"s_98":"I'm on my way."
