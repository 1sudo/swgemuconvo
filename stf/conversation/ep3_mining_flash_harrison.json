Me, the best mining pilot in the Galaxy, stuck here on the lost planet of the furballs by Imperial order!  This is no place for Flash Harrison, mighty pilot!  Who are you, anyway?",	"s_234":"We have no further business to discuss.",	"s_239":"What are you standing around here for?  Go!  Off!",	"s_240":"Alright, alright...",	"s_25":"You look like you could use a hand.",	"s_256":"What are you staring at?",	"s_26":"Who, me?  You really think you can 'give a hand' to Flash Harrison, greatest pilot in the Galaxy?  Huh...I suppose you can.  Between you and me, I'm working for the Corellian Engineering Corporation on a mining project in Kashyyyk, but the Imperials suspect that I'm a Rebel sympathizer!",	"s_35":"That's too bad.",	"s_36":"Tell me about it!  They took my ship, and I'm stuck here with these filthy, dangerous Wookiees.  I'll get off this rock as soon as I can, but until then, can you get a message to our base of operations on Talus?",	"s_38":"Absolutely.",	"s_40":"You may not be the best pilot in the Galaxy-- like me--but you'll have to do.  Good luck, pilot!",	"s_42":"Not today.  Good luck escaping.",	"s_45":"That's more like it.",	"s_46":"Hey, you can't just leave me here!  Come back!"
