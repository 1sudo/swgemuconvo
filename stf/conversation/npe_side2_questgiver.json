It appears to still be working.",	"s_17":"That's better than I could have hoped for! Some of these images are also of people that died in the Clone Wars, and I miss them terribly. This reward seems like far less than you deserve, but it's all I have.",	"s_18":"I hope it isn't gone for good. Sometimes I can still hear them.",	"s_19":"Thank you.

Please come back when you have completed your training."
