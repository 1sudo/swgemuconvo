You are obviously not qualified to handle my needs yet.",	"s_16":"What are you doing here? I told you to hurry.",	"s_17":"Hey, you! Looking for a job?",	"s_19":"Depends on the job.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"I need you to deliver a package for me.",	"s_23":"As in a smuggled item?  I hear bad things about smugglers.",	"s_25":"It's not like that at all. I just need someone to drop this off. Someone who is not me. I am being watched. You are new here, and should be able to move around without suspicion. So are you in?",	"s_27":"I suppose.",	"s_29":"Okay, meet Maghr Scutu in the Atrium. He will give you directions on how to deliver the package.",	"s_31":"You delivered the package, I trust?",	"s_32":"Yes, I did just as you said.",	"s_33":"Good job. Best to keep this between us.

You just need to have a ship first.",	"s_41":"Where do I get one?",	"s_42":"Talk to Serissu, she will teach you what you need to know. Come back when you are done.",	"s_43":"No, I think I have enough to do already.",	"s_45":"hmph, you couldn't handle it anyway.",	"s_46":"Thanks for your help earlier.",	"s_48":"Do I know you?"
