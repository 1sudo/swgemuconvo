Rumor has it that this cell has enough stored energy to power an entire Star Destroyer, but small enough to fit into a backpack. My sources have also informed me that the Rebel Alliance is planning an assault on the city to steal this new technology, something the Empire will not stand for. Comments?",	"s_14":"How do you know your sources are correct?",	"s_16":"I cannot comment on the status of my sources. But I will say that there are signs of a major military buildup by the Empire. Their officials have been quoted as saying it is a security force sent in to protect the city of Restuss. If that is the case, then why have they quarantined Restuss? And if rumors are true, the Rebels have also begun establishing a base somewhere near Restuss.",	"s_18":"It certainly sounds like a battle is brewing.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Of course there will be a battle. I wouldn't be here if there was going to be a peaceful solution. Marles Jacobe is where the story is.",	"s_22":"I think it is...bad?",	"s_24":"...Great. Can I quote you on that?",	"s_26":"No thanks. In too much of a hurry.",	"s_28":"Understood. The battle brewing and all. You had better be off.",	"s_4":"Hey there, traveler. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about what has been going on around here?",	"s_6":"Sure, I guess so.",	"s_8":"I am Marles Jacobe of the Corellia Times. I am investigating the military buildup here in Restuss. It has already caused the entire city to be evacuated, displacing thousands of families. And with tensions running high there is sure to be a showdown. What are your thoughts on this whole situation?"
