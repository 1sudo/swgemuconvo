Thank you.",	"s_17":"That is too bad. We are going to have to go back to our original plan and start hunting tulrus in the area again. Hopefully, we will get another break and you will get it this time.",	"s_18":"I am afraid that I do not have time to talk to you right now. We have a crisis brewing here and I need to focus on getting the problem dealt with.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Maybe I can help.",	"s_22":"Hmmm...you do look like someone who might be able to help us. There has been a series of attacks on our miners by a tulrus. Those things normally don't bother anyone unless provoked, but this one seems different. It has already attacked numerous miners, killing several of them. Our crews refuse to go out unless we can take care of the problem.",	"s_24":"I am an expert hunter. I will help out.",	"s_26":"That is the best news I have heard all day. We do not know which tulrus is doing this, so I am afraid we are going to have to kill tulrus in the areas of the attacks until we find it. Find tulrus and examine their stomach contents. That is the only way we can be sure.",	"s_28":"Sounds like you have a lot to deal with. Good luck.",	"s_30":"Thank you, stranger. We will do our best.",	"s_4":"Hey, ever since you took care of that tulrus, our productivity has been up. We can't thank you enough.",	"s_6":"You do not know how much better all the men feel. Thank you for taking down that rogue tulrus. The company has authorized me to issue you this reward for your service. Thank you again, my friend.",	"s_8":"We really need to find that rogue tulrus. The attacks are getting worse and our crews are scared."
