Beat it so I can get to work. I don't think you're supposed to be back here anyway.",	"s_501ea131":"Scrub the? Excuse me?",	"s_5afecbb7":"Uh...yeah Jeffy. Funny huh?",	"s_60900624":"Hahaha! That's funny stuff!",	"s_62f865dd":"I'm here to scrub the plasma injector.",	"s_67a590c3":"I'm here to clean the antimatter condenser.",	"s_6aa58622":"I'm really, really busy. It's a complete mess around here. The Empire has been laying it into Nym for some reason and the damaged ships keep rolling in. I've had to replace two engine cores today alone!",	"s_76ac95c":"Uh...okay...",	"s_8358e7c8":"I'm sorry to hear that.",	"s_b0c60048":"What? You don't scrub a plasma injector. Those things are stored in sealed containers and fused into engines. Is this some kind of joke? Did Jeffy put you up to this?",	"s_b44f916c":"I don't get it. Look, I'm really busy. Can you come back later?",	"s_b7141451":"Get moving now.",	"s_cbb1bec7":"Clean the antimatter condenser? Well...yeah I suppose it's probably getting a little jammed with all of the work we've been putting it through. You can find the Snaff Grease in the back. Hurry up though, there's probably a bunch of ships waiting to be fueled up.",	"s_f49a789f":"I'm here to wax the matter inducer."
