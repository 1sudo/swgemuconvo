Busy stealing, perhaps?",	"s_14":"Stealing? Saving a population is more like it. You don't know who you work for, do you?",	"s_16":"What do you mean?",	"s_18":"Now what?",	"s_19":"Notice that Gremlo failed? Give me the prototype, or die.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Never mind.",	"s_21":"I can't convince you otherwise. Take it.

Give me the prototype now.",	"s_52":"Yes, the Empire doesn't need any more deadly weapons.",	"s_53":"You leave me no choice. Gremlo, kill.",	"s_54":"Very good. Take this back to [Businessman]. Thank you.",	"s_55":"Thank you...just thank you."
