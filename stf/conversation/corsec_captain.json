Do you really think I have time to talk to you? Sorry, I don't mean to be rude, I'm just busy.",	"s_18":"Where's Maerzen? Where's the evidence? You didn't forget did you?",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Aldalad was killed? I can't believe it! I'd say you're pretty lucky.",	"s_26":"No, no. You're still on leave. I can't have you tiring yourself out. The six years you did undercover has earned you a nice long vacation.",	"s_27":"Why do you say that...?",	"s_29":"They could have gotten you, too! That would have been terrible.",	"s_30":"Yes, um...that would have been bad.",	"s_32":"Fortunately, it's not over.",	"s_33":"It's not?",	"s_34":"Maerzen just made contact with me. He's found a bunch of evidence and he needs someone to escort him in. I had him land in a remote spot and told him you were on the way.",	"s_35":"Yes. Great. I'll do that.",	"s_37":"I knew you would. Maerzen's dying to see you. Just bring back the Maerzen and the evidence, and everything will be settled.",	"s_39":"I, uh, just remembered I need to do something.",	"s_41":"Why are you asking me?",	"s_42":"I can't imagine.",	"s_43":"Um...let me know if you figure it out.",	"s_44":"Hm? Oh, don't be so touchy. I'm just saying it's strange is all. But you have the evidence? That's fantastic! It's got to be processed right away.",	"s_45":"Processed?",	"s_46":"Well, let's not leave Maerzen out there too long. Come back as soon as you possibly can.",	"s_47":"Yeah. Say, why don't you take it over to Evidence Storage, and then take a few days off. This must have been tough on you.",	"s_48":"Yeah. I think I'll do that.",	"s_49":"Great. As soon as the evidence is processed we can start arresting Borvo's men. Thanks for all your hard work.",	"s_5":"They killed Maerzen? Oh, this is just too much! It's like they know every move we're going to make before we make it. How do they do it?",	"s_50":"Me neither. Well, I guess the evidence needs to be processed.",	"s_51":"Um...processed?",	"s_52":"Ok. I'll do that. Say, where are you off to now? Don't forget to come back and see me!",	"s_54":"This is too weird. I have to go.",	"s_56":"It's disturbing right? Being back on the streets? You did a pretty long stretch of undercover, I can understand how you feel. Just come back when you're ok.",	"s_58":"I can't stand this anymore. I'm done.",	"s_60":"Well, Ok, I guess. You've been acting a little strange. Oh, now I see! You're not feeling well. Ok, get better and then come back.",	"s_62":"You haven't found him? That's strange, he should be right there where I said. Maybe you should go look again.",	"s_64":"Oh...Oh, my! That badge! you're Agent Niksel. You look exactly like I thought you would. So, you've returned!",	"s_66":"Um...yeah, I guess.",	"s_68":"This is incredible! We didn't know what had happened to you. I expected a report from you. What happened? Did you forget to send it?",	"s_70":"Uh...yeah, that's what happened.",	"s_72":"Well, now you're going to have to go get Aldalad. He's ready to testify against Borvo and his crew. Bring him back safely. You're the only one I trust for this assignment.",	"s_74":"Aldalad? Who is that?",	"s_76":"Who is that? You can't have forgotten...oh! I see! You're still, 'in character' as they say? Yes? Great. That's fantastic.",	"s_78":"Can you remind me about Aldalad, then?",	"s_80":"Yes, he's the one Borvo sold all those illegal weapons to. Now he's ready to testify and spend his life free on the beaches of Corellia. Good deal for him, yeah?",	"s_82":"I'd say so. Yeah, I'll go 'get' this guy.",	"s_84":"I can't do this. I'll, um...come back later.",	"s_86":"I'm getting out of here.",	"s_88":"I'm right on it, sir.",	"s_90":"Great. Bring him back safe. You're the only one who would recognize Borvo's assassins, so keep one eye open.",	"s_92":"Maybe this can wait.",	"s_94":"I can't take it. I'm going to go.",	"s_96":"I need to go get a drink.",	"s_98":"Don't be gone long. I'll be expecting your return!"
