Did you come here to see if I had lost my touch?",	"s_12":"Actually I am here to ask you to help me reverse engineer it.",	"s_14":"I doubt I can be of much assistance for that.  It is true that I worked at a factory that built that model but my position was purely managerial.",	"s_16":"You must know something technical.",	"s_18":"The first thing to come to mind with that model is the defective Temperature Control System.  Many thought it was the timing mechanism that was defective but it was really the fact that the temperature was never adequately regulated.",	"s_19":"I have heard that.  Can you point out the defective system?",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Yes. It is right here.  You should really make sure this system works properly or else the fryer is nearly worthless.",	"s_24":"I hate to ask...but is there anyone else that might help with the reverse engineering process?",	"s_25":"I know the current location of a droid that was assigned schematic revisions for that model.  Would that help you? ",	"s_27":"Uh.  Yeah.  I have a feeling that might be exactly who I need to speak with.",	"s_28":"Here you go.  His name is A5 S5 but everyone calls him 'Otonon Tracks.'",	"s_30":"I'm sorry. I am waiting for someone else that looks sort of like you, only better looking.",	"s_4":"Hello.  What brings you to me?",	"s_9":"I am looking for Nore Brrea to ask some questions about this fryer."
