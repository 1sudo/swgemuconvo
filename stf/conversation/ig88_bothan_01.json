Good the circuit board is intact. Now let me load the data on to your datapad.",	"s_12":"That's it?",	"s_14":"Yes, now get back to Kaibe. He is expecting you.",	"s_16":"This is my disguise.",	"s_18":"You change your mind, and want me to make you a disguise?",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"No, I just wanted to say hi.",	"s_22":"Well hi, now get back there.",	"s_24":"No, I just forgot what to get.",	"s_26":"Amateur. Here I have reloaded the information to your datapad.",	"s_28":"Go away, you have no proof!",	"s_30":"Proof? Kaibe sent me.",	"s_32":"Oh! In that case, what are you doing standing around. Let's get your disguise made.",	"s_34":"Disguise?",	"s_36":"Yes, how else are you going to get in? Let me see what I can put together...",	"s_38":"...",	"s_4":"Was there something else? I am busy making my disguise for my next contract.",	"s_40":"Well, I am out of sufficient parts to make you retain your own personality. But not to worry, I will take good care of you.",	"s_42":"Um... Can't I just go in without a disguise?",	"s_44":"... It's possible, but you would be in great danger.",	"s_46":"Danger? Hah, I am not scared. Just tell me what I need.",	"s_48":"Well in that case, I just need a circuit board from Tao-Ni Security's mainframe. But to get it, I need you to overload the system, so their backup systems don't wipe the data.",	"s_50":"How do we do that?",	"s_52":"Easy, just get me some charged capacitors from the security droids there. We can use them. I will contact you when we have enough.",	"s_6":"Did you get them? How did you do this without a disguise?",	"s_8":"I didn't need one, I just took what I wanted."
