I hear you're handy against the local wildlife. Is that true? I hope it is. I need you to help me out now.",	"s_12":"What can I do for you?",	"s_14":"The local children are getting sick. I'm not paranoid enough to think someone's doing it deliberately, but there's definitely something going around. I need to make some medicine, but I don't have all the ingredients that I need. I was hoping you'd collect them for me.",	"s_16":"What do you need?",	"s_18":"Well, to start with, I'll need something to kill the infection. Believe it or not the venom of a fanned rawl is the perfect toxin to do this with. Mixed with the right chemicals of course, I wouldn't recommend getting bit just to cure a flu. But I'll need you to bring me venom sacs, intact, from about 9 of them.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Nine venom sacs. Can do.",	"s_21":"These ingredients will do perfectly. Thank you for your help.",	"s_23":"Anything else you need?",	"s_24":"Eirtae, another of the sisters, has asked for your assistance. She'd like to speak with you as soon as you get a chance.",	"s_25":"I need those ingredients as soon as possible.",	"s_26":"Good. When you're done with that I'll let you know what else I need.",	"s_28":"I'm sorry to have to put this so bluntly, but I don't talk to strangers.",	"s_4":"I appreciate your help collecting the ingredients for the medicine. The children appreciate it too."
