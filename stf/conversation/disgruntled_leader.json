You tell Nym that this is only the beginning. We need things fixed around this city. You tell him I'm making a list and if he thinks this is the last he's heard from us then he's got another think coming! And that's not all, we...",	"s_17":"You're welcome.",	"s_18":"Fine!  Walk off while I'm talking! Nym will hear about how rude his so-called 'Champion' is, too, you can count on that!",	"s_19":"Look. We need Nym to take care of some basic needs! It is obvious by his total reluctance to talk to his citizens that he doesn't care. But I bet he will when we all leave. Maybe a better name for this hole is Nym's Ghost Town!",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"Take it easy. I'm...",	"s_23":"How about you make yourself useful and fix the water supply before we all die.

And another thing...!",	"s_30":"My grievances will be heard by someone in charge!",	"s_8":"Who are you?"
