Oh wait--you don't look like you're a pilot. Sorry, I was waiting for someone else.",	"s_21a1e8c0":"Straight from Dantooine's system. What a neat story! I think the Information Guild will be pretty excited about this one.",	"s_36989baf":"Wow Tatooine! I hear about so many things happening in that system. Thank you for the great story. I should definitely get that promotion soon!",	"s_3c1f9431":"I guess I can help.",	"s_446fdc1d":"A freighter?! Hey, you're mean! Oh well.. I guess I can take it. Here's your pay. Be nicer to people!",	"s_45768069":"Endor! What's going on up there, anyway? I keep hearing weird rumors. The people would love to know! This story will go into our next paper.",	"s_46258640":"Psst! Hey! You look like you're a pilot! Am I right? I could really use your help if you are. I'm in a bit of a bind.",	"s_4bab1b65":"Naboo.. what a pretty place. And it has news! Thank you so much for this!",	"s_5432ff59":"I need more of an explination. Where do I get this 'information'?",	"s_579e662c":"Uh.. no thanks. I'll be going now.",	"s_57b843a1":"Dathomir.. What a scary place! Was it dangerous up there? I sure am glad you're okay. Thanks so much for doing this!",	"s_5a59fcdc":"Sounds good. I'll go look and come back.",	"s_66dce3ab":"I don't know a lot about Lok. But it sure seems like interesting things are happening there! Thanks so much!",	"s_83d5af87":"You don't know how much this is gonna help me out! Thank you!",	"s_9030290e":"I'm an intern at the 'News Now!' Information Guild. If I don't get enough news stories, they may let me go. I can get some, but not enough to make me the top reporter. I'm really aspiring to be the best, you know? What do you think? I'd pay you, of course.",	"s_9176a524":"Wow, I'm *so* grateful! Okay, so space systems, right? If you go to any of those, like Corellia or Tatooine for instance, an enemy has a chance of dropping a little tidbit of news. If you bring those to me, I'll pay you a generous sum. Some are worth more than others, you see. Like risk and reward, you know? Look for 'a log', or 'a diary'. Those are exactly what I need.",	"s_9208410d":"...",	"s_9b448b0d":"Yavin 4, huh? Hmm.. Aha! This is a great story. I should get a pat on the back for this one at the guild. Thank you!",	"s_b36ae370":"Corellia.. home of the Alliance, right? I hear they're pretty troublesome! I really don't pay too much attention to the war between the EMpire and the Rebellion. I should, shouldn't I? This is a great story, by the way. Thank you.",	"s_b4192cf":"You're back so soon! I knew you were the right one to help me. Didja' find anything? If you did, just give it to me by dragging and dropping. Okay, I'm waiting!",	"s_c33acdc8":"Oh no! I'm going to be a failure!",	"s_d89d872a":"No, sorry.",	"s_e339c89e":"What do you need done?",	"s_e35ea3ad":"In the space systems, of course! Like Corellia and Tatooine except all over. You know? I guess I'm not making much sense. If you find yourself in a dogfight up there, just check to see if they drop 'a log', or 'a diary' or something. Data disks that contain information, you know? Those are what I need. Just give them to me and I'll pay you."
