Why would you be looking for them?",	"s_13":"I'm not really sure, actually. I am told they are special.",	"s_15":"You can say that again!",	"s_17":"What do you mean by that?",	"s_19":"I bought them from Watto intending to attach them to an R-type droid I am building. But they wouldn't work. I had them laying around and next thing I know an Imperial Captain barges in and demands them.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"What did you do?",	"s_23":"What could I do? He was confiscating the part. I gave them to him. I really wish I hadn't though. I probably could have bluffed him.",	"s_25":"I found out why my friend was after that Imperial.",	"s_26":"Why didn't you want to give them to him?",	"s_28":"Because a friend of mine came in shortly after looking for them as well. When I told him what happened he seemed to get rather anxious.",	"s_30":"What did he do?",	"s_32":"Well you see, he's a pilot. He took off after the Imperial Captain in his ship. He radioed me later and said he shot up the captain's AT-ST.",	"s_34":"Why would he do that?!",	"s_36":"He told me he was looking for the droid part as well. I really wish I would have just kept that part, instead of getting my friend mixed up in blowing up an AT-ST.",	"s_38":"Sounds to me like he knew what he was doing. Did he give you a location?",	"s_39":"Why is that?",	"s_40":"He told me not to talk about it.",	"s_42":"Yes, but you have to promise me you're not going to arrest him or anything!",	"s_44":"I promise I won't arrest him.",	"s_46":"Ok, this is where he said he blew up the AT-ST. I think he is still there.",	"s_48":"Thanks.",	"s_50":"Please don't hurt him!",	"s_52":"I sure hope my friend is ok.",	"s_7":"Hi, what brings you to my home?",	"s_9":"I am looking for some droid legs you bought from Watto."
