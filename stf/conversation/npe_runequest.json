Did you find them all?",	"s_12":"Those runes you found for me did wonders for my career! I can't repay you enough!",	"s_14":"Not yet. I have to look for them still.",	"s_15":"Yes, I found them all. Here's your paper.",	"s_16":"Oh, thank you! Let me take a look at them. Yes, perfect! Here. Take this as your reward for helping me. I'm so grateful!",	"s_17":"Thank you.",	"s_18":"No thank you.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Okay. Well, good luck to you! I hope you come back soon!",	"s_22":"Oh! I didn't see you there. Nice to meet you. You know, this place is rather dangerous. You should be careful.",	"s_24":"I will be. Why are you here?",	"s_26":"I guess I don't seem to be the adventuring type, hm? I'm an archaeologist. Within this haunted place, there are runes that I'm quite interested in. They're written on the altars of the Rak'qua tribe. I just can't seem to get to them on my own.",	"s_28":"Maybe I can help somehow.",	"s_30":"Oh would you? Here. Take this. You can trace over the runes onto this sheet of paper. I need eight rubbings, but I only know the locations of six. You will have to find the last two on your own. Will you still do it?",	"s_32":"I'll do it.",	"s_34":"Great! I'll wait for you eagerly.",	"s_36":"Finish your training, then come back to see me."
