I have to get off this planet.",	"s_111":"Why don't you just take the shuttle then friend?",	"s_112":"And what do you want from me?",	"s_113":"I'm sorry. I have some things I have to attend to right now.",	"s_114":"What do I look like, a shuttle ticket vendor?",	"s_115":"Please... I've lost everything...",	"s_116":"Will you come back? I've lost everything. I need some help...",	"s_117":"Yeah, I might. You hang in there, friend.",	"s_118":"I need to sell this crystal. Please, only a thousand credits and this beautiful shard could be yours.",	"s_119":"Interesting. It's all black. I might want it. Where'd you find it?",	"s_120":"A thousand credits for a piece of glass? I don't think so.",	"s_121":"Please, I beg of you. I'll go with 500 credits, please.

One evening, when I was out surveying, I saw the strangest thing. A man that was all covered in strange blue glowing dust was kneeling down, looking at something. He hadn't seen me, so I kept looking at what he was doing. After a while he stood back up and walked away. I ran up to the spot where I saw him, and there in between some rocks, I found this beautiful crystal.",	"s_128":"If it's so beautiful, why are you trying to get rid of it?",	"s_129":"I've had nothing but bad luck lately and I've lost everything. I need the credits to be able to get back home...",	"s_130":"Fine, 500 credits we said right?",	"s_131":"500 credits is too much though.",	"s_132":"Right, right. Here you go. Take it now. Please.",	"s_133":"Then take it for free! Just take the darn thing!",	"s_134":"You don't have the money on you? Please, go get it now!",	"s_135":"Please, help me... I need to get off this planet.",	"s_136":"What do you want..?",	"s_137":"I was wondering if you would like your crystal back?",	"s_138":"I'm here to give your crystal back.",	"s_139":"No way! It's all yours now. I don't want that blasted thing back!",	"s_140":"I'm not taking that! The thing is evil!",	"s_142":"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.",	"s_144":"Try me.",	"s_146":"I came to this place in hopes of finding fortune.

Just take the darn thing!",	"s_161":"I've had a string of bad luck and lost everything. That's why I'm hoping that you would want to buy this crystal from me, for the cheap price of a thousand credits.",	"s_162":"It looks very nice. Where did you find it?",	"s_163":"A thousand credits is a little steep...",	"s_165":"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.",	"s_167":"I'm very open-minded.",	"s_169":"I came to this place in hopes of finding fortune.

Just take it, please!",	"s_185":"Fine, fine. I'll go down to 500 credits.",	"s_187":"Hmm, maybe.

I'm still here. Since you took the crystal, my luck sure has turned! I won a mining spot from a Mustafarian in a bet, and it turns out the resources I can get from it are worth millions! So I'll be around for a while...hehe.",	"s_72":"I wish you were more experienced... I could really use some help."
