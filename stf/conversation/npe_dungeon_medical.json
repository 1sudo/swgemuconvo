Are there things of value to acquire here?",	"s_105":"Hello, young master. Did you tell master Frelka?",	"s_106":"Indeed there are. You can vanquish enemies to get them. Many explorers hoping to find a quick credit or two often come here.",	"s_107":"Oh, thank you! Please, do come back soon.",	"s_108":"Thank you, but I think I'll leave now.",	"s_109":"I have some questions still.",	"s_110":"Of course. Just be careful out there!",	"s_111":"Why are you here, young master?",	"s_112":"Just want to check this place out.",	"s_113":"It's very dangerous.

Finish your training before you venture too far, young master.",	"s_122":"This is Station Gamma. It was once a research facility for Car'das allies, but now it has been taken over by the Rak'qua and their creations. It is a tough place to explore on your own. You might consider finding a group of friends to go in with you.",	"s_124":"What happens if I die?",	"s_126":"If you meet an unfortunate demise, you will end up here. You're safe among the Car'das.",	"s_128":"Should I look out for anything in particular?",	"s_130":"You should be mindful of the Rak'qua Overlord.

Before you go, can I help you with any questions about this station?",	"s_146":"Welcome back, young master.",	"s_147":"The Rak'qua Aphotic... he's gone.",	"s_148":"Oh, wonderful news! You should go tell Master Frelka. He'll be most pleased.",	"s_149":"I'll do so. Thank you.",	"s_150":"I have some questions still.",	"s_152":"I will do my best to answer them.",	"s_154":"What is this place?",	"s_156":"This is Station Gamma.

What is this place?",	"s_43":"It's a very dangerous one. You should leave as soon as possible.",	"s_45":"I can take care of myself.",	"s_76":"Did he send you here to defeat the Aphotic?",	"s_77":"Who is that?",	"s_78":"It's a long story. The Aphotic hurt Frelka. I'm surprised he didn't say anything. I guess he doesn't want others meddling in his affairs.",	"s_79":"I want to help him.",	"s_80":"I don't know... I guess it couldn't hurt, could it? Find the Rak'qua Aphotic and defeat him for Frelka. The Aphotic should be very close; perhaps in the very beginning of this place. He'll be hard to miss.",	"s_81":"Easy!",	"s_82":"I wish you luck, young master. ",	"s_84":"I want to ask you a few questions.",	"s_85":"Do you need help with anything?",	"s_86":"I will do my best to answer them.",	"s_88":"What is this place?",	"s_89":"Oh, indeed I do. My master, Frelka, was horribly battered by something named Aphotic...Rak'qua Aphotic, perhaps.",	"s_90":"This is Station Gamma.
