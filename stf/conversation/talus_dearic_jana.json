",	"s_19":"I've been sent by Agent Taarna of CorSec to investigate this facility.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"Were you able to kill him?",	"s_22":"I can't believe you did it. The entire base has been cleared. ",	"s_23":"You have saved all of Talus. You're a hero.",	"s_24":"What do you want me to kill again?",	"s_25":"The queen's mate. I already told you!",	"s_26":"Could you tell me again?",	"s_27":"He is much larger and stronger than the rest. He was designed to be exceptionally durable. The queen is tough in her own right, but much of her mass we had to dedicate to reproductive functions. Her mate however, we could design to be almost entirely devoted to combat. I don't think any one man could take him down.",	"s_28":"Well, I took care of the mate. He won't be 'morphing' anytime soon.",	"s_29":"You really are good at your job. here take this. I was saving it to sell later, but I don't think I want the responsibility of restarting this whole mess. You take it and do with it what you want.",	"s_30":"Is this thing alive?",	"s_31":"Alive but dormant. It won't hatch, but it's a queen egg, it has the potential to restart this entire process. Guard it well.",	"s_32":"Right...",	"s_33":"Goodbye.",	"s_34":"I must say, you're very good at your job. We only had the containment failure a few hours ago. How did you find out so fast.",	"s_36":"I was dispatched to a crash site northeast of Nashal and the clues there led me here.",	"s_38":"You found the crew? How are they? I knew someone on the ship, his name was...",	"s_40":"No one survived. The creatures killed them all.",	"s_42":"I...I see. They'll kill us all too, you know.",	"s_44":"I'm here to prevent that. I have orders to destroy them completely.",	"s_46":"You seem so confident, I'm not so sure you can kill them all.",	"s_48":"Why do you say that?",	"s_50":"The queen's mate. He is much larger and stronger than the rest. He was designed to be exceptionally durable. The queen is tough in her own right, but much of her mass we had to dedicate to reproductive functions. Her mate however, we could design to be almost entirely devoted to combat. I don't think any one man could take him down.",	"s_52":"Why does he matter? If I destroy the queen and her breeders, then he will eventually die without a mate to help propagate the species.",	"s_54":"We designed him with adaptive biology. If he is the only arachne left, he can morph into a breeder. Even without a mate he can repopulate the species. It was a fail safe in case the rest of the product had been successfully eradicated.",	"s_56":"Very efficient of you.",	"s_58":"You must kill him as well. You will need help though.",	"s_60":"I will gather some allies and kill the mate.",	"s_62":"I hope you do, for all of our sakes.",	"s_64":"Just passing through the area. What's going on here?",	"s_66":"This lab has had a creature containment failure. They have overrun the facility. I don't know if there are survivors or not.",	"s_68":"I could check for you.",	"s_70":"I don't know about that. It's extremely dangerous.",	"s_72":"I can take care of myself. What do you need done?",	"s_74":"Well, first off it's going to take more than just you. I suggest you find some help before taking this on. ",	"s_76":"Understood. So what is it we would be up against?",	"s_78":"The base is being cleared by a CorSec crew, but I don't think they understand the power and strength of the queen's mate. I also don't think they understand his biological potential and may bypass him as an unnecessary risk.",	"s_80":"What's so special about him?",	"s_82":"He is much larger and stronger than the rest. He was designed to be exceptionally durable. The queen is tough in her own right, but much of her mass we had to dedicate to reproductive functions. Her mate however, we could design to be almost entirely devoted to combat. I don't think any one man could take him down.",	"s_84":"Yea, that's terrible, but as I was saying I'm just passing through.",	"s_86":"Of course, better to leave this to the authorities. Goodbye.",	"s_88":"Look out for mutant spiders."
