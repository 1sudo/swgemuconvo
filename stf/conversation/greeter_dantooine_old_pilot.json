I fly various jobs for people in these parts. Not that far back, I reconditioned an old starfighter and use it for my work. Can't stand being grounded, so I had to do something. My old bird won't stand for atmospheric flight, but she's more than enough for flying low altitude jobs.",	"s_6c0fd0e6":"What's an old mule like yourself doing here?",	"s_7c2b99a8":"Hey, what's a young whippersnapper like yourself doing on Dantooine? ",	"s_88a2ef9d":"Enough with the 'sir' alright? Just call me Yras, if you're gonna call me anything.  Anyway, I fly various jobs for people in these parts. Not that far back, I reconditioned an old starfighter and use it for my work. Can't stand being grounded, so I had to do something. My old bird won't stand for atmospheric flight, but she's more than enough for flying low altitude jobs.",	"s_961d42dc":"May I ask what you do around here, sir?",	"s_a93a834e":"You didn't answer my question, old man?",	"s_c4d3634f":"Ah spirited, are you? Last time someone showed that kind of spirit, we buried him the next day. Or what was left of him anyway. But don't let that stop you... this planet isn't kind to anyone, spirited or not.",	"s_c74b4365":"Nothing sir. Just passing through.",	"s_c8012fa1":"Meek as a Naboo winter. You're not gonna last a day here, youngster. Best add some backbone."
