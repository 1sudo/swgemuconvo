There're pirates in the lower holds, wild creatures in the Atrium, and nothing is being done about it! My sister was killed because of it!",	"s_13":"I'm sorry to hear that. It's terrible what happened to her.",	"s_14":"Yeah, ya think? No one on this station cares and no one will drop those invaders out an airlock. If something isn't done soon, I'll be forced to take control of the situation myself. I have a disruptor rifle that I found in a room below. They'll pay!",	"s_16":"Would she want you to become a murderer?",	"s_18":"I think she would understand. She was...",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Would she want you to put the station in more danger?",	"s_22":"No, but I...",	"s_24":"Would she want you to become as monstrous as her killer?",	"s_26":"I guess not. I'm going to talk to Inaldra and try to get her to see reason. ",	"s_29":"Yes. That's enough to upset anyone.",	"s_31":"Upset?! You don't know the half of it. No one is paying any attention to the casualties, and we're just supposed to do our jobs and smile about it! Well, I have a disruptor rifle that says differently.",	"s_33":"You should do something about it!",	"s_34":"Whoa there. Your sister wouldn't want you to be a murderer.",	"s_36":"You should do something about this.",	"s_38":"Yeah! I should! It's bad enough that these idiots see us as pawns to be used and discarded, but to get our families involved... it's too much.",	"s_40":"Go dust off that disruptor rifle.",	"s_42":"How did you know that I have...yeah. I will.",	"s_44":"Leave me alone. This station is going to ... never mind. Just leave me alone.",	"s_5":"Go away. I don't want to talk to anyone.",	"s_7":"Thank you for keeping me from doing something stupid.",	"s_8":"What's wrong?"
