That's all you need to worry about.",	"s_18":"So what if I refuse?",	"s_19":"I let the local authorities know you were the one that killed those gangers. Then all you have to worry about is dodging the law and Jabba's hitmen.",	"s_2":"",	"s_27":"Jabba says you're good muscle. Well I need a rival gang roughed up.
