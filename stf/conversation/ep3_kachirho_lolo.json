		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (ep3_kachirho_lolo.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor.",	"s_100":"Sorry...no time to talk. Work, work, work. I always have orders to fill and schedules to keep.",	"s_101":"I am looking for a bowcaster. A special bowcaster.",	"s_102":"A bowcaster eh? Well, I am afraid that you came to the wrong place. I do not have any in stock at this time. Maybe I could put you on a waiting list.",	"s_103":"What do I do to put the bowcaster together?",	"s_104":"Make a barrel. Add that in with the power handler and the feed mechanism and you will have a bowcaster. It is extremely simple...even a unskilled weaponsmith could put it together. Well, I told you everything that I can. I hope that Jobarkko isn't to upset with me over this...it wasn't my fault.",	"s_105":"Sure, I am ready to take care of him now.",	"s_106":"No thanks, maybe later.",	"s_107":"Take care then.",	"s_108":"Good luck to you.",	"s_19":"Actually, Jobarkko sent me to look at the new bowcaster.",	"s_254":"There is nothing more that I can do for you.",	"s_255":"Ok, thanks and see you later.",	"s_256":"Can I do that space part again?",	"s_257":"Bye bye.",	"s_258":"Sure.",	"s_76":"This is just great. I am sorry that Jobarkko wasted your time. The bowcaster is gone. Well...I guess technically not gone. I still have the schematics for it but I am afraid that all of the parts needed to put it together have been taken.",	"s_77":"Taken. What do you mean, taken?",	"s_78":"Everyone was so excited about this new bowcaster that no one would actually wait for me to put it together. The resistance shows up here before I could assemble the weapon and starts arguing about what to do with it.",	"s_79":"The resistance was fighting amongst themselves?",	"s_80":"That shouldn't surprise you. How else do you think a relatively small group of Trandoshans can control an entire population.",	"s_81":"Well, they are backed by the Empire.",	"s_82":"Bah! The Empire hasn't had an effective military in this sector for many years now. They leave the operation to their loyal lap dogs. If they had to operate a full military force in this system to maintain control the cost would out way the reward of the slave labor. But I don't think they will have to worry about that for a long time.",	"s_83":"What do you mean?",	"s_84":"The resistance spends most of their time fighting each other rather then fighting the Trandoshans. Everyone wants to be in charge. Take something as simple as that bowcaster. Two factions of the resistance show up and want to see it. Of course, both of them start to argue about what they want it for. One of them wants to sell it to the highest bidder to fund an operation and the other wants to use it help in the fight.",	"s_85":"So what happened to the bowcaster?",	"s_86":"",	"s_87":"Rowarro. Grrrrllll. Roorroww.",	"s_88":"Ah, you have the pieces. That is great. I will put them together for you and give you the correct part. Put this part together with the barrel and the power handler to make the bowcaster.",	"s_89":"No luck with that pilot? No matter. He is still out there if you would like to give it another shot?",	"s_90":"I have told you everything I know. If you manage to get those parts for the feed mechanism I will happily put them together for you. Take care.",	"s_91":"Yes? What can I do for you on this fine day?",	"s_92":"Well they started fighting and made a complete mess out of my store. Both groups grabbed parts of it and made a run for it. Not that those parts will do them any good since I still have the schematic for the gun and the barrel. One group took the feed mechanism parts and tried to ship it off world. The other grabbed the power handler and went back to their camps.",	"s_93":"So how would I make one of these bowcasters?",	"s_94":"I can give you the schematic for the barrel and the bowcaster. They are useless to me now. As for the other stuff you will have to recover them from the Wookiees who took them from me.",	"s_95":"Alright. Where can I find these parts?",	"s_97":"I heard that the Wookiee who took the parts for the feed mechanism had hyperdrive problems and is still in the system. You can probably get a lock on his distress signal. It is in pieces but if you can recover it and bring it back to me I will put it together for you. And it would be my guess that the leaders of the other group took the power handlers and issued them to their troops to put into their weapons already.",	"s_98":"So they will have put the handlers in their weapons?",	"s_99":"No. Those power handlers are specifically designed for the new bowcaster. But I would be willing to bet that any number of the resistance fighters in the area are carrying them around anyways."
