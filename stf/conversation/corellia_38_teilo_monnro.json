He comes into my shop and destroys whatever I'm working on. But no more! Because I'm going to pay you to go into that cave and stop him.",	"s_44":"I'll be glad to help.",	"s_45":"No, I don't think so.",	"s_46":"Thank you.",	"s_47":"Oh. Well, did you happen to see anyone else who might be willing to go in and teach him a lesson? I guess I'll wait here and hope someone else shows up.",	"s_48":"I knew you could do it. Now I'm finally free from Hrath's menace. Such a relief, I cannot tell you.",	"s_49":"In the cave, you'll find a Meatlump named Hrath Koo. Teach him to leave people alone and not to destroy their property."
