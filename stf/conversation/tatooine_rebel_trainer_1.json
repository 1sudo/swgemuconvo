Try sniffing around Wayfar... you'll find something that suits you.",	"s_19ec1fce":"Just how exactly do you expect to be a Rebel Alliance pilot without a ship?  Here.  I'll add these access codes for a small fighter to your datapad.  You ought to upgrade to a better ship pretty soon, though.",	"s_1a1806c1":"Okay, okay. I'm sorry.",	"s_1b488c78":"I'm... not sure",	"s_1c2f3f24":"The Force be with you, then...",	"s_1d3d8b65":"You don't look like any sort of pilot to me.  I can't help you.",	"s_1e626caa":"Of course. Those supplies are critical!",	"s_1eed018e":"Fun? This is war, my friend. There's nothing 'fun' about having your friends swept away by the bloody tides of battle, losing your home, your future, everything that ever meant anything to you...",	"s_1f0828c5":"Report mission status!",	"s_1f7c77cd":"The Force be with you.",	"s_22ce0785":"No, you're not!",	"s_2313ac9e":"What are you talking about?",	"s_23567daf":"I know that you are making the right decision, friend.",	"s_236daee8":"So would you like a duty?",	"s_2427d272":"Well... I'm sorry.",	"s_2477af4a":"For the Alliance... always.",	"s_2784686":"So the Empire knows a bit more than we expected. This is very bad news, pilot. Alliance HQ will want to learn of this attack as soon as possible.",	"s_282":"There is none, it is your job to find them pilot. Search the Tatooine system for targets of opportunity.",	"s_286":"The Force be with you.",	"s_288":"And with you as well.",	"s_288ce434":"Ma'am! Thank you, ma'am!",	"s_290":"Will you train me after this?",	"s_299":"No.",	"s_29b9c1a7":"Use your zone map interface to locate space stations while in-flight.

Now, get some rest and check back with me later. I will have more for you to do.",	"s_2dfa0bf9":"When do I get paid?",	"s_2e56f341":"You're not supposed to be here, pilot. You're assigned to Major Eker's group on the moon Yavin IV.",	"s_2ea6d944":"Really?",	"s_2f0da72f":"Superb! We have located a rally point from which the Empire has staged their recent aggressions. Go to this point and bring down a veteran TIE fighter pilot - the ringleader, as it were.",	"s_2f8ec5d4":"Report on the TIE veteran target!",	"s_2fdfe99f":"Then we shall begin.

We could really use someone like you in our organization. Are you willing to place your trust in the Rebel Alliance?",	"s_347e4a03":"Ma'am! Yes, ma'am!",	"s_34bc4ce6":"Yeah, right. Prove it!",	"s_35":"What a surprise. I'll grant access to one of the refurbished Z95's we have hidden here on Tatooine.

You need to complete a few assignments before I'll train you.  Are you ready?",	"s_39":"Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_39f7d683":"What a surprise. I'll grant access to one of the refurbished Z95's we have hidden here on Tatooine. Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_3b6d2f05":"Whatever...",	"s_3cb5ab17":"So thrilling... ",	"s_3ccb2ef2":"I responded to a distress call, ma'am!",	"s_3d693d0":"I will bring honor to the Alliance, ma'am.",	"s_3f1a842c":"Yeah, yeah.",	"s_3f30cd7b":"(Brag more)",	"s_3f5c320e":"I know of the rebellion.

Use them wisely.",	"s_4416b2d0":"Outstanding. Your responsibility is to run a short-range, four-point patrol. When you are finished, your ship's sensor data will be downloaded to the Alliance 'net for Intel to review. Any questions?",	"s_45":"I need a space ship.",	"s_4536f86f":"Yes. If you're lucky...",	"s_463f3bbc":"I anticipated as much. Good work, pilot! Check back with me soon for your next assignment.",	"s_47":"What a surprise. I'll grant access to one of the refurbished Z95's we have hidden here on Tatooine.

I didn't catch that...",	"s_4c1acfbf":"And you performed beautifully. The Alliance thanks you.  I've got something special for you.",	"s_4c695dbd":"No.",	"s_4e8bbd4d":"The Force be with you, friend...",	"s_4f90bab3":"I was unable to finish.",	"s_4ffd4b9d":"I am interested in a duty mission.",	"s_51":"Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_5100b9ac":"You're learning, then. Good. Try again!",	"s_52efbcd5":"I hear you had some surprises up there?",	"s_54ec182b":"I failed to destroy the targets.",	"s_55":"I need a space ship.",	"s_55ce5bee":"Nothing you can't handle. Destroy the veteran TIE pilot leader at a specific rally point. Come back here... if you survive.",	"s_55ea0c1b":"Relax, lady. I didn't mean anything by that!",	"s_57":"What a surprise. I'll grant access to one of the refurbished Z95's we have hidden here on Tatooine. Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_57a53dcf":"Where do I find them?",	"s_57c3f83e":"Always good to see another Rebel pilot... but you're not one of my recruits. What can I do for you?",	"s_583707c4":"(Lie about what happened.)",	"s_59":"It's about time.",	"s_59c382bc":"Good day, pilot. Are you here for elective duty mission? There is still plenty of work for us here in Tatooine.",	"s_59dceadb":"Now you need to go to the starport. Go inside and look for a 'starship terminal.' Use the terminal to launch your starship into space. When you launch, a waypoint will be created to help guide you back to your landing spot. When you want to land - comm the space station and ask for landing clearance.",	"s_5aa307dc":"Piece o'cake, lady.",	"s_5b4a6885":"It's a flightsuit.  You'll look like a real pilot, now.",	"s_5bfac9f1":"Where's my starship?",	"s_5c7ecf43":"That's good to know. You're dismissed.",	"s_5d157c36":"Just try not to stir up any pirate action - and don't fire on any Imperials unless they threaten you.",	"s_5f15e36":"I know only that it involves researching the Death Star space station technology. With so much wreckage in the area, the Alliance has an opportunity to deconstruct the Empire's elite doomsday weapon... and prepare an adequate response if they were to build another one.",	"s_61":"Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_6106187c":"What is a duty mission?",	"s_616dbcc8":"Save it! I'm assigning a new mission to you. Don't come back until it's finished!",	"s_618c3a1c":"Very well, %NU. You can change your level of commitment to the Rebellion using the /pvp command. This will allow you to switch between being a combatant and in special forces.",	"s_61c8b0c2":"Then you will be glad to know we have reliable information that the Empire is rallying TIE fighter forces at a nav point high above Tatooine. They are being led by an experienced TIE veteran. Eliminate this TIE veteran pilot with extreme prejudice. This should bring their plans crashing to the ground.",	"s_6221bd32":"Congratulations, pilot. Our immediate goals have been met. We have time for training.",	"s_6360ad02":"Any Imperial activities. This is a little-used Alliance supply route. It will become more important in the near future - and we are concerned that the Empire has knowledge of our operations.",	"s_63642f8":"It appears that our time together has come to an end, pilot. Alliance HQ wants you reallocated to special operations on Yavin IV and placed under the command of Major Eker... immediately.",	"s_63c4c628":"You must try harder! The Alliance doesn't stand a chance with pilots like you... with your attitude!",	"s_640d20f4":"Yes ma'am!",	"s_6440d5e7":"Target the space station and then comm the space station. Most likely the station will recognize you and will comm you first. But if you are in a hurry, use SHIFT+C to target the space station and open communication with the station commander.",	"s_648f0fc":"You really disappoint me, pilot.",	"s_64b4e5f7":"(Brag about blasting TIE fighters)",	"s_658f174d":"What am I looking for?",	"s_6657b5a3":"It wasn't my fault!",	"s_66ae2bdf":"Then tell me what you want or get out of here.",	"s_66dc0f99":"Interesting. Alliance HQ has a number of possible Imperial rally points for you to investigate. These 'duty' missions have been prepared for you to gain some much needed space combat experience. You can return to the ground at any time when you feel that you have learned enough. Good luck!",	"s_67104689":"He has joined the infinite, Da'la.",	"s_680cda08":"How do I get back from space?",	"s_68ee2577":"I could not finish the mission.",	"s_6a0aba27":"I would like to patrol Tatooine space.",	"s_6a150013":"Let's have some details.",	"s_6a7a0499":"(Brag about blasting even more TIE fighters)",	"s_6b490480":"(Salute) Affirmative!",	"s_6b52240":"Not just yet, Pilot!  I have a few more assignments for you before I can train you.  Are you ready to get to work?",	"s_6bb935f1":"Yes, Da'la. I am ready.",	"s_6cf8e18b":"(Tell a bold lie.)",	"s_6d7d5f1b":"All targets eliminated, ma'am!",	"s_6e646769":"No, thanks.",	"s_6f3e992":"What can you tell me of Major Eker?",	"s_70":"Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_705f0112":"Train me to fly for the Alliance.",	"s_7077f9f7":"Outstanding!",	"s_71239ef6":"I don't want to hear it. Consider yourself lucky to be alive.",	"s_71370b1e":"Good! Try again!",	"s_74":"Ma'am, I require a starship.",	"s_740e2e66":"Sorry, ma'am!",	"s_74474b33":"What is our next move, ma'am?",	"s_7478cd28":"Will you train me after this?",	"s_7553991":"Yeah, yeah!",	"s_766563c7":"Nothing I couldn't handle.",	"s_768b62bc":"Just let me in your club, okay?",	"s_77":"Thank you very much.",	"s_784540b7":"Greetings, pilot! Are you ready for your assignment?",	"s_78679b31":"Sounds like fun. Where do I sign?",	"s_79":"Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_790724e4":"Then it is fortunate that we have met. I can induct you to the Alliance pilot training program immediately.",	"s_79e3a94":"When you're done with the mission, slaymo.",	"s_7a27e11":"I'll blast any Imperial who crosses my path!",	"s_7d15be50":"I am more than ready, Da'la.",	"s_7d2cd92d":"Then it is my pleasure to welcome you to the Alliance space navy.",	"s_7d4eaca7":"I don't know.",	"s_7e1ada01":"Yeah, yeah...",	"s_7e77b672":"Shouldn't you be thanking me?",	"s_7ed5fec3":"I want to be part of the Alliance.",	"s_7eff4d79":"Perhaps you will show Major Eker more respect. The Major is currently located at the labor outpost on the moon Yavin IV. I've placed the location in your datapad. Good luck, %NU.",	"s_7f3c5f06":"We can't hold your hand all the time pilot. Search the system, you're bound to find some!",	"s_7f9b8387":"Why not?",	"s_8001a590":"Outstanding! Find any Imperial TIE Fighters in the Tatooine system and take out at least four of them.",	"s_8234fa32":"Yes... I am willing. Yes.",	"s_8268c49d":"We can skip the moral lesson, sister.",	"s_831a22ee":"I know the dangers",	"s_834edaa1":"Good. Then get back out there!",	"s_84d7bb8e":"Your enthusiasm is welcome, friend!",	"s_855c7780":"I've heard that Eker was a decorated Imperial pilot and leader of a vicious TIE squadron for several years... until he sickened of their tactics. I believe he defected after being ordered to fire on an unarmed medical transport.",	"s_8631e93":"I don't want to leave. I want to help.",	"s_8685174d":"I do, ma'am.",	"s_87":"Thank you very much.",	"s_8720792f":"You will fly a four-point patrol above Tatooine. We will need your ship's sensor data when you are finished. Stay hidden... sorry to say, I have a bad feeling about this one.",	"s_877e028c":"Ma'am! I want another chance, ma'am!",	"s_87a8cca7":"How will I know this pilot?",	"s_89":"Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_8916a30":"It should not be difficult. He should be one of very few veteran TIE fighter pilots in this vicinity. But, if you want to be thorough... bring down any TIE fighter pilots you see in this area.",	"s_8a4652c6":"So now what?",	"s_8a78d00e":"Only TIE fighters, ma'am?",	"s_8a7cca63":"You got LUCKY! You need to get your act together or you'll be space dust. Understand me?",	"s_8b9926b6":"Affirmative. Report when your patrol is complete.",	"s_8be95ab4":"What's this?",	"s_8da0fa08":"Are you sure about that, %NU?  We could officially put your name on the roster, but even if you remain Covert, there's always a chance of an Imperial uncovering you.",	"s_8e0b0814":"Hm. You're not making any sense. Why don't you try this mission again?",	"s_8ef10336":"Affirmative, ma'am!",	"s_90377ed4":"Affirmative!",	"s_9109c202":"An Alliance freighter needed my help.",	"s_91d36035":"I think you're going to get fried up there if you don't take this seriously.",	"s_92e1301f":"Don't worry. I will be fine.",	"s_93470245":"How should I stay hidden?",	"s_9487e7cd":"Something might be looking for you, pilot... so be careful.",	"s_949ea1ef":"Just four should do it. We want the Empire to understand that their intel is compromised. This will buy us some time for other operations. Any more questions, or are you ready to shut up and get to work?",	"s_95":"Thank you very much.",	"s_95310ec0":"You have done great things here in Tatooine, %NU... but the Alliance needs you on Yavin. The stakes in this conflict are continuing to rise, and our pilots must go where they are needed. I am sure you will flourish under Major Eker's command.",	"s_95ad8f55":"You bring honor to the Alliance, my friend. This was no easy task.",	"s_968c130f":"No. I will not!",	"s_97":"Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_9757e73a":"You'll be covering a little-used Alliance supply route. It's become more important in recent days because of Imperial activity outside the asteroid belt. We have plans for this area, and need to know that we'll remain unseen.",	"s_97e129cd":"Where is the rally point?",	"s_97e13b2e":"(Brief Da'la with all due accuracy)",	"s_987055b5":"We can always use cannon fodder. Welcome to the Alliance.",	"s_994615e7":"This is good - for some day you shall rejoin the infinite... and I may then be allowed to rest.",	"s_9a159641":"When you are done with your patrol, you will need to find your way to a space station above Tatooine. Communicate with the station operatives and request landing clearance. The rest is automatic.",	"s_9b562c5a":"Don't make this more than it is, pilot. This is not 'search and destroy' - this is a sensor sweep. Stay out of trouble. Come back in one piece!",	"s_9c146b24":"I don't like what I'm hearing, pilot! Report, now!",	"s_9e21ae0d":"I truly hope so.",	"s_9f625af9":"That's better! You're assignment is a four-point patrol above Tatooine. Keep your sensors running the whole time - and when you come back, we'll want to download the data.",	"s_a018cd7e":"Let's give Alliance HQ a moment to digest this information. A change of plans may be in store...",	"s_a13bb0b0":"I hope I don't regret this. I hereby admit you into the Alliance pilot training program.",	"s_a20f8416":"The recent Imperial activity is being led by a veteran TIE fighter pilot. We know of his location. Fly to the nav point, and eliminate this pilot with extreme prejudice.",	"s_a42932d7":"I will need a starship.",	"s_a45033de":"Okay, so it was mine.",	"s_a46d9f8b":"Our next move? We wait. Alliance HQ is going to want time to review our situation and re-evaluate our combat options. Check back with me later...",	"s_a5ecfd93":"You think you can handle a simple four-point patrol?",	"s_a6c2aaa1":"Then you rejoice! You're still alive, you're done with your assignment, and life is good... right? Come back here when you're done so I can give you your next assignment.",	"s_a6ec653a":"Focus! You need to get over yourself or you won't be any use to us.",	"s_a7a6018f":"Hm. Interesting. Are you ready to try again?",	"s_a87c06b":"I already know what happened. Do you have anything to say for yourself?",	"s_a89f2288":"The Empire plans to move several wings of TIE fighters into this zone. If they are allowed to succeed, it could spell disaster for the Alliance here on Tatooine.",	"s_a8b44679":"(Brag about defeating the TIE Veteran)",	"s_a9163b5e":"Whose fault was it, then?",	"s_a93c5fce":"Well, it takes all kinds, doesn't it? Welcome to the Rebel Alliance.",	"s_a994ca63":"For the Alliance!",	"s_aa521016":"Looking for something in particular?",	"s_aadc4812":"Well, I'll admit that I didn't prep you for a TIE fighter attack. How do you think you'll fare on your second try?",	"s_ab56e9c6":"Do you have more target information?",	"s_ab640430":"Critical to say the least, my friend. We must resume supply flights as soon as possible. To accomplish this, we need you to sweep a five-point area. Again, your ship sensor data will be used to plot an effective route for our larger transports.",	"s_abc65d0":"Okay. Bye!",	"s_ac596e57":"Outstanding! I'll see you when you're done!",	"s_aceff31e":"Good luck, pilot.",	"s_adacb6c2":"Well... the Empire's?",	"s_add5c243":"Well... do something about it!",	"s_ae1edd02":"While you were away we gathered enough information to put the Imperial fleet movement out of commission. Are you ready to take flight again?",	"s_aed0dff":"I will require a starship.",	"s_b0778713":"The Empire does not yet know that their fleet info has been compromised. Strike the new TIE fighters moving into this area with extreme prejudice, and they will have no choice but to halt their invasion strategy.",	"s_b2133e77":"Not a problem. I'll grant access to one of the refurbished Z95's we have hidden here on Tatooine. Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_b2683b4a":"Piece of cake.",	"s_b2c15146":"Unfortunately, since you are not part of my unit, I cannot assign you missions. You should probably return and speak with your commanding officer.",	"s_b3408be1":"Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_b3bebc5e":"How do I get there?",	"s_b3e9c738":"I'm ready for anything.",	"s_b5719d30":"Then get back out there and make it happen, pilot!",	"s_b7af9aa":"Are you kidding me?! Not your fault? I have grown so sick of your attitude... I just can't stand it! Tell me you're going to get back up there and do it right this time!",	"s_b7b3029f":"Get on with it, lady.",	"s_b91ba199":"Outstanding! Check back with me when you are ready for your next assignment!",	"s_b9c55cab":"I failed the mission.",	"s_b9c90f82":"Well... maybe you are.  But this is more important, right now.  I'll make a deal with you, complete this mission and THEN I will train you.  This is urgent, so I hope you're ready.",	"s_baae2f70":"(Salute) The Force be with you.",	"s_bac616e6":"I'm ready for my next mission!",	"s_bb68963e":"You'll be the death of me, pilot.",	"s_bb761ef6":"This is unacceptable! You get back out there and finish this mission, pilot!",	"s_bc865091":"Probably.",	"s_bd53784c":"Ma'am, I require a starship.",	"s_bda1eb17":"Your ship sensor data has been completely decoded. The Alliance supply route is entirely compromised. We need you to scout a new route for our in-system supply convoy. Are you up to it?",	"s_bf55aded":"Great. You can either patrol the Tatooine system looking for Imperials to send to the scrapyard, or you can help escort Alliance transports. What sounds good to you?",	"s_c19ed115":"You've got your assignment, and the control device for your ship in your datapad.  Go to the Starport and access the terminal to launch into space.",	"s_c261cfae":"No problem.",	"s_c3d77bb4":"Expect the rally point to be patrolled by junior TIE cadets. They will be quick to respond if they see you first - so be very careful. Keep your eye out for the veteran TIE fighter pilot, eliminate him, and get back here as soon as you can.",	"s_c4b9eaff":"Maybe you should try again. And this time... don't fail!",	"s_c4c3d546":"How do I comm the space station?",	"s_c5ac7e76":"I don't have any pressing assignments right now, but I do have some elective duty missions if you're interested?",	"s_c5cc6139":"It's about time.",	"s_c62cae3d":"Good luck, my friend.",	"s_c7939f2f":"What are we looking for?",	"s_c8fa77b8":"I can't wait!",	"s_c92d07b4":"Sure. Why not.",	"s_c9c9c683":"What do you think, sweetie?",	"s_ca06f3a2":"We cannot afford for you to fail, pilot. The Empire outnumbers us - outguns us... the only hope we have is to out-fight them! Are you ready to try again?",	"s_ca0c0b13":"What's wrong with you? Get out there and prove your worth!",	"s_ca51315f":"Always.",	"s_cac4a12c":"Don't worry, I'll have a gonzo patrol ready for you when you come back!",	"s_cb60fa8":"A duty mission is a good way to earn experience. Especially for a pilot looking for training like yourself. Duty missions have no real end. You just finish when you finish, know what I mean? So what do you say?",	"s_cc82ca6b":"Good! Your orders have been renewed. Good luck, pilot!",	"s_cd0ae4c4":"The Force be with you, Da'la...",	"s_cd1af2b9":"Outstanding! Good luck, pilot!",	"s_cd68fc71":"Well, I'm not getting any younger.",	"s_ce2c09ec":"Mission accomplished, ma'am!",	"s_ce6b43af":"We have reason to believe that the Empire is moving a wing of TIE fighters directly into an Alliance supply route. We need to know more.",	"s_cf04e474":"What more do we know of this TIE veteran?",	"s_cfba4c0a":"We exchanged messages through the Alliance 'net right after the Battle of Yavin. He was in need of pilots then, too. So, we didn't discuss anything outside of that. Of course, I have heard rumors of his history before joining the Alliance... but nothing concrete.",	"s_d01d0154":"No, never mind.",	"s_d0233b4b":"The Force be with us.",	"s_d038a005":"And then what?",	"s_d18e28ba":"Maybe I got that completely backwards. Who knows?",	"s_d497fa22":"Charming. What can I do to get you out of here?",	"s_d4f7f6d5":"And with you as well.",	"s_d5c41154":"What rumors?",	"s_d6c8f764":"Heh. What do you know. An Imperial. Get out of here while you still can!",	"s_d6e44b20":"You're right. The Alliance is attempting to move a large number of refugees out of Tatooine space. Protect as many of them as you can. These 'duty' missions have been prepared for you to gain some much needed space combat experience. You can return to the ground at any time when you feel that you have learned enough.",	"s_d70dba34":"Yes.",	"s_d731f764":"(Shrug and smile.)",	"s_d779178a":"What other targets are in the area?",	"s_d7f5cd5b":"You have no clue, do you?",	"s_d806feaa":"A number of slightly-used Z95 starships are parked around Tatooine... hidden from Imperial eyes. The codes I uploaded to your datapad will allow you to assume control of one. Just head down to the starport...",	"s_d8913d37":"If it is my duty, Da'la.",	"s_d89a93ff":"%TU, you're too impatient.  Right now I need you to scout that supply route.  We'll talk about training later.",	"s_db6b2243":"We are kindred spirits, Da'la Socuna.",	"s_dcbc639a":"The mission is a success, Da'la.",	"s_dcf7d387":"I don't think this is going to work out, pilot.",	"s_ddea1965":"What's the job, honey?",	"s_e03d1a04":"Hm. This does not sound like a random encounter. I would bet the Empire has knowledge of our operations here. Alliance HQ isn't going to like this report... but I'm very glad you're safe and sound.",	"s_e095ac8":"I need a space ship.",	"s_e0cb3e19":"I'm ready to enlist with the ground forces!",	"s_e24d9d51":"You already have. Good luck to you... I hope to see you again very soon.",	"s_e28249ac":"I'll be back in a snap!",	"s_e28bc942":"Hmph. Take off. Find any Imperial Tie Fighters in the Tatooine system and take out at least four of them.",	"s_e2a3d627":"Fly there, Pilot. Your ship is equipped with a hyperdrive. Major Eker is in the Medical Center at the labor outpost on the moon Yavin IV. I've placed the location in your datapad.",	"s_e31d65b7":"The duty logs indicate that you are in mid-mission. We have nothing to discuss until you are finished.",	"s_e42b260e":"I'm on my way.",	"s_e9da2a94":"More TIE fighters, huh?",	"s_eab1caa8":"I'm not in the habit of making excuses.",	"s_eb7aaed2":"Yes I am!",	"s_ed5af630":"Excellent. Good luck, pilot.",	"s_eff4eef6":"If we are to have any dealings together, you will need to officially join our side. Go find a Recruiter and sign on the dotted line friend.",	"s_f1147d11":"There is none, it is your job to find them pilot. Search the Tatooine system for targets of opportunity.",	"s_f29cdd1":"Understood, my friend. I'll grant access to one of the refurbished Z95's we have hidden here on Tatooine. Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_f2ef125b":"Lucky for us.  Here's a little bonus for you.",	"s_f4642ca3":"It's a multipocket bandolier.  I'd get you a flightsuit but I don't think I have one that would fit you... anyway, this will help you keep your things organized.",	"s_f4cc85fa":"Not very much. You may find more than one in the general area - but Alliance intelligence indicates that the Empire has charged one veteran TIE pilot with coordinating aggressions in this system.",	"s_f5255b8a":"Major Eker and his special operations team have a wide-range of responsibilities on Yavin IV. Before you head off, I want you to appreciate just how dangerous this assignment could be.",	"s_f6e9edd":"You shall have one. I'll grant access to one of the refurbished Z95's we have hidden here on Tatooine. Are you ready for your first assignment?",	"s_f7ebcc5f":"Will you fail a second time if I re-assign the mission to you?",	"s_f80372b3":"I'm ready for training?",	"s_f843dc6a":"(Salute) Yes, ma'am!",	"s_f892eb03":"I make no guarantees.",	"s_fb7175d6":"Get your act together!",	"s_fb9b39e5":"Report, pilot!",	"s_fbac0bde":"(Salute) Ma'am! Yes, ma'am!",	"s_fc1f4e33":"Okay, fine!",	"s_fcd9ce0e":"This cannot stand, pilot! We need you to take down that Veteran TIE pilot!",	"s_fdb94a71":"What do you know of the Yavin 4 operation?",	"s_fe789dac":"Report!",	"s_ffb79794":"I will complete the mission, ma'am!"
