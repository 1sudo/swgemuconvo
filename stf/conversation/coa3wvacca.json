Once it runs out Dead Eye will be useless.",	"s_11d4164":"What's the status of Dead Eye?",	"s_6d583b5":"It wasn't because of Rebel activity. It was a whim. A cold, heartless, whim of Grand Moff Tarkin. He wanted a demonstration of the Empire's power, so he killed an entire planet. I now know the truth, so I couldn't work for them anymore.",	"s_8e697de4":"Oh. Hello. I'm sorry, but they really don't want me to talk to anyone not associated with the project. You understand.",	"s_913b747e":"You're the one who sent me the message from the Princess. I really have to thank you. I was deluding myself for far too long about the Empire. I'm glad I was able to give Dead Eye to the Rebellion .",	"s_96405da8":"What was the reason?",	"s_b2b7f750":"What can be done?",	"s_ba517076":"After reading the message from Princess Leia I realized that I had blinded myself to the evils of the Empire. After further communications I had my eyes opened to the real reason Alderaan was destroyed.",	"s_bbc96393":"Why did you choose the Rebellion?",	"s_be18866d":"Ah, you're the one who is helping us fight the Empire for Dead Eye.",	"s_d24fb27":"If we can find an alternative flora resource, we can try to make another version. We have a number of research stations scattered about a number of planets testing various samples."
