		"s_ff45f1fd":"Good luck to you, Captain %TU!",		"s_fd75abb":"You bet! New droid algorithms in there should make you more than a match against a dozen Ay'Nat Ghost Fighters!",		"s_f93088f1":"Palace security system?",		"s_f6ae3b07":"What's the job?",		"s_f32117e":"You bet! New defense procedures should make you more than a match against a dozen Ay'Nat Ghost Fighters!",		"s_eff66f4d":"I am interested in reactor engineering algorithms.",		"s_ef08027f":"That's excellent news for the peaceful citizens of the Naboo system.  I know you're not in this for the money, but I've got something for you.",		"s_ec671b3f":"Well, the Empire has demanded that the prisoners be turned over for questioning. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Regardless... are you up to escorting the prisoner transport?",		"s_eac39719":"Sorry, kiddo. You're still in need of training! Come back when you've learned to handle yourself better. Good luck!",		"s_e9c57758":"Elite starfighter assassins?",		"s_e95a95a5":"I believe you have some business to attend to... in space?",		"s_e42b260e":"I'm on my way.",		"s_dc649bb3":"I'm on my way!",		"s_da8818c5":"If you say so, %NU.  I still say it's an impressive accomplishment.  You've really earned your pay this time.",		"s_d8472b3c":"Well then welcome aboard! I'm Captain Kaydine - Naboo's most decorated starfighter pilot, president of the Flying Color Guard, the Chancellor-elect of the Naboo Betterment Society, and all-around local celebrity!",		"s_d70dba34":"Yes.",		"s_d65590b1":"Keep it",		"s_d586f458":"Excellent! Get back out there and do me proud!",		"s_d2ffe31e":"Excellent!  Here's your pay.  I suppose you want to take some time off now and relax?",		"s_ce72ef85":"Just kidding",		"s_c8f39347":"I am.",		"s_c89c3456":"How do you do! Captain Kaydine - the most decorated starfighter pilot in the Royal Security Forces... at your service!",		"s_c892e540":"Destroy Ay'Nat Legion pirates in this system.",		"s_c5fcc7f5":"Greetings, Captain %TU! Are you ready to take my place on the duty roster?",		"s_c4ef0e93":"We need you to slip in to Ay'Nat-controlled space, and hunt down a trio of Ace outlaws.",		"s_c261cfae":"No problem.",		"s_c1ff5062":"I'm looking for a mission. Do you have any?",		"s_be7af651":"What?  I mean... oh.  Well, ok then.  Uh.  Here you go.",		"s_bb45477c":"Excellent choice! What starfighter do you have your eye on? Are you interested in the Kimogila? Or are you obsessed with that hideous Kihraxz Light Fighter like all the other kids?",		"s_bb291959":"Excellent! Be careful up there! Those Ay'Nat outlaws are deadly enemies!",		"s_b45e2166":"I had some help",		"s_b104c183":"A fine choice, my friend. I will add you to the Queen's duty roster. Good luck up there!",		"s_b0ab3e88":"Oh!  You had me going there.  Well you've earned that, anyway.",		"s_b0704da1":"I want to fly for the RSF!",		"s_afe7700f":"Well?  Was your mission a success?",		"s_ae21cb72":"Thanks to you!  Great work, %NU.  You've really earned these credits.",		"s_aae78dca":"I think it's time for you to take on more responsibilities.  Head deeper into the palace, my friend! Look for Commander Dulios. He'll set you on the path...",		"s_aa83c988":"Head deeper into the palace, my friend! Look for Commander Dulios. He'll set you on the path...",		"s_aa77ffde":"It was nothing",		"s_a91b70fb":"Those Ay'Nat are the worst! You bet! I'll be updating the duty roster with your pilot info presently. Good luck!",		"s_a80d9308":"Good luck!",		"s_a6c7fa2b":"What are the details?",		"s_a0c23472":"Did you capture the Ay'Nat captain?",		"s_a0072111":"Hm. A grim job if there ever was one. I respect your courage. Good luck!",		"s_9ea46a82":"Palace security system. Sees all. Tells all. I'm guessing you're here about the job?",		"s_9ce4dd83":"Ah, yes! You'll certainly need the strength of the M12-L if you're going up against the Ay'Nat Legion's elite starfighter assassins. Definitely!",		"s_9b73da8":"Protect the Royal Kylantha cargo.",		"s_9af8d581":"Ready to go up against the Ay'Nat Ghost Fighters?",		"s_9abb9538":"Fantastic work!  The space station holocomm'd me regarding a massive battle between a lone RSF pilot and a legion of Ay'Nat pirates.  I knew that had to be you!",		"s_9928bf27":"You're an odd one, %NU.  But you do deserve to be compensated for the risks you take.",		"s_9817b9bb":"No, I don't.",		"s_9560d48e":"Yes. How did you know?",		"s_943f6352":"Alright. Hurry up and come back when you're ready.",		"s_92dbc95c":"Kihraxz Light Fighter",		"s_9248b2ba":"Well you've certainly earned it.  I'll talk to you later.",		"s_8f5942fa":"I am interested in starship defense training.",		"s_8f2e1055":"So there are missions?",		"s_8d90962a":"Nonsense!  You've earned this.",		"s_8b529447":"Woah, hey there. Are you ready for your next assignment? There's lots to be done!",		"s_8ad6a62e":"You bet! New components should make your ship more than a match against a dozen Ay'Nat Ghost Fighters!",		"s_8a84109d":"It must be your lucky day. I actually do have some elective duty missions. Take a look and tell me what you want to do.",		"s_86a73ee1":"Sorry... I forgot to mention... We have a mission. Or rather, I have a mission and you've got to do it. ",		"s_86358e09":"Ghost Fighters?",		"s_85263c6d":"We can't afford to botch this opportunity! RSF has a new battery of information... and another chance to bring the Ay'Nat captain to justice. You interested in trying again?",		"s_837686a5":"How do you do. Captain Kaydine - the most decorated starfighter pilot in the Royal Security Forces... at your service!",		"s_7cc7c206":"Well then, welcome aboard! I'm Captain Kaydine - Naboo's most decorated starfighter pilot, president of the Flying Color Guard, the Chancellor-elect of the Naboo Betterment Society, and all-around local celebrity!",		"s_7bc9bef7":"You're a real work-horse, %NU.  You remind me of myself.  Which duty are you interested in?",		"s_7ac0f961":"How do you do. Captain Kaydine, at your service.",		"s_76e6f264":"Captain %TU! You are doing a fantastic job! I think you've grown enough as a pilot to warrant advanced training. What area interests you most?",		"s_7614c65":"Yes, it does.",		"s_7458c693":"Sorry, kiddo. You don't have RSF clearance to fly any of my missions. You'd probably have better luck with your own contacts.",		"s_726bdb69":"Good! Then let's get you back out there right away!",		"s_725573da":"What now?",		"s_70287826":"Now that's showing some excellent leadership potential!  You've really earned your pay this time.",		"s_6da2c92b":"I realize there were a lot of fighters up there to deal with... but nothing changes the fact that the Ay'Nat Legion must go! Are you ready to try this again?",		"s_6cd96c01":"Of course! There's no end to the missions... and there's no time for me to do them. Your job will be to take my place on the RSF duty roster - in exchange for training, which I will personally administer. Sound like a good deal?",		"s_6c6f3940":"How do you do sir! Captain Kaydine, at your service.",		"s_65042122":"So, I hear you were not able to destroy all three of the Ay'Nat Legion's outlaw fighters. But don't worry - I'll get RSF record keepers to hold off marking this one a failure. You ready to try again?",		"s_63053557":"Good! What duty element do you want to participate in today?",		"s_6114e8b7":"I'm ready for duty",		"s_5fa9a5d3":"Thanks",		"s_5e2a2bb1":"Sounds good.",		"s_588f56b2":"The ship is safe",		"s_58362a8d":"Tell me about it.",		"s_57ba8a73":"In that case, let's get you back up there. This time make sure the RSF prison ship makes it out of the system. Good luck!",		"s_4aa3066e":"Ah yes! Good choice! Learning to fly many different types of ships makes an effective pilot!",		"s_4a743aa7":"The Ay'Nat pirate legion is mounting an aggressive campaign for control here in Naboo. They're building fast... so we need to strike at their leadership, and send them scrambling.",		"s_4a1d2431":"Yes, I'm ready.",		"s_464cfc61":"Greetings, pilot! You must be Captain %TU. Am I right?",		"s_45d20070":"I need training",		"s_45b71b4d":"I am interested in advanced fighters.",		"s_4495137d":"Sorry, I'm a bit distracted... did you hear how the RSF Guard foiled an attempt by Ay'Nat Legion pirates to detonate proton packs in the Palace reactor? ",		"s_43148596":"Did you catch those Ay'Nat outlaws?",		"s_3db3463f":"How do you do civilian! Captain Kaydine, at your service.",		"s_3cef63a0":"Fly out to your choice of strike points... look for Ay'Nat Legion fighters. Likely, if these are hired for support - they will come out if you start tearing up the rank-and-file. ",		"s_394f0902":"Good day to you! Captain Kaydine - the most decorated starfighter pilot in the Royal Security Forces... at your service!",		"s_387397fb":"Did you hear how the RSF Guard foiled an attempt by Ay'Nat Legion pirates to detonate proton packs in the Palace reactor? ",		"s_370822d1":"Yes",		"s_36a4e374":"Yes, I am.",		"s_35fb22d6":"The Royal family has increased security in the wake of recent theft. A number of Her Majesty's personal freight ships have been hijacked in recent days. This is partly why you're here, I imagine... because we're hiring space pilots?",		"s_34ac61a2":"The 'Kimogila'",		"s_32c46e00":"Where should I go?",		"s_326deced":"No, I am in this for the money",		"s_30297e22":"Recover ships stolen by the Ay'Nat Legion.",		"s_2fd7906f":"Why do all you kids want to fly around looking like pirates? Ugh! But... I'll admit... you will need the handling capabilities of the Kihraxz Light Fighter if you're going to survive a pre-emptive strike against the Ay'Nat Legion's elite starfighter assassins! That's for sure.",		"s_2e7b17f3":"It's very likely you'll fall under attack from Ay'Nat Legion pirates. Be careful...",		"s_2dee44ae":"You bet! A new starship would probably do a lot better against some Ay'Nat Ghost Fighters!",		"s_2d86b58b":"Hey, kiddo! What are you still doing around here? You got bigger, better things to be doing! And truth be told... I got nothing more to teach you, %NU.",		"s_2d67b7a8":"Where do I come in?",		"s_287eca83":"We needed to get that prisoner ship out of the Naboo system to keep the Empire happy. You don't want the Empire to be angry with us, do you?",		"s_2847218":"Being a war-hero, my life is rather complex. I perform a long list of Palace functions... almost none of which involve starflight. For those matters, I need able-bodied pilots such as yourself.",		"s_24d86e89":"Great! In that case, let's get you started. I will update your flight status, and append the RSF codes to your datapad. Check back with me in a few minutes...",		"s_24b7f2f":"Excellent choice. This will especially come in handy since the Ay'Nat pirate legion is mounting an aggressive campaign for control here in Naboo. They're building fast... so we need to strike at their leadership, and send them scrambling.",		"s_225b33f":"Good luck, son!",		"s_2017d4b5":"Ah yes! Good choice. Now there's no time to lose. We'll need you to catch up to the Ay'Nat Captain's personal starship... a rather fast vessel! Disable him, and protect an RSF Boarding Team while they arrest him.",		"s_1c7ee38e":"You'll find it handy in your next mission! We'll need you to catch up to the Ay'Nat Captain's personal starship... a rather fast vessel! Disable him, and protect an RSF Boarding Team while they arrest him.",		"s_1c2b565d":"Not quite yet, sir.",		"s_1b428a9f":"Yes, Captain. I'm ready.",		"s_197f4f94":"I am interested in intermediate starship component use.",		"s_168f5655":"I guess I forgot to mention this earlier... but yes, we have a mission to destroy a squadron of Ay'Nat Ghost Fighters that have been sighted outside of RSF controlled space.",		"s_130b925b":"We'll need you to catch up to the Ay'Nat Captain's personal starship... a rather fast vessel! Disable him, and protect an RSF Boarding Team while they arrest him.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (naboo_privateer_trainer_2.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
