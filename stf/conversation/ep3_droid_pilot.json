As well, my piloting logic has been affected by a plasma leak in the cockpit.",	"s_189":"Who attacked you?",	"s_191":"The tactical computer indicated that the attacking vessels were piloted by 'Gotal Bandits.' I have copious information on this criminal group... but I cannot retrieve it.",	"s_193":"Why not?",	"s_195":"The plasma leak has affected certain areas of my main memory. I no longer have access to certain languages, draft schematics, pilot programs, and my entire galactic encyclopedia.",	"s_197":"Can you fix it yourself?",	"s_199":"Not now. Once I jump to hyperspace, I can attend to these issues.",	"s_201":"Who can fix this?",	"s_203":"I will be fine once I make the jump to hyperspace.",	"s_205":"We can skip the information-dump.",	"s_207":"If I understand you correctly, I agree.

Categories include: mercenary, cybernetics, and bio-engineering.",	"s_245":"Mercenary?",	"s_247":"The data under that category is the most complete of my records: Gotal bandits have, in recent cycles, organized their offensive forces... intent on filling gaps created by other, more powerful pirate clans...

I'll protect you.",	"s_340":"Your kindness is appreciated. No doubt you will become an Ace pilot for the Civilian Protection Guild.",	"s_343":"What is the Civilian Protection Guild?",	"s_345":"I...
