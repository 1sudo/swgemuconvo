What are you doing here?",	"s_17":"Your friend Syndil sent me, she is worried about you.",	"s_19":"She worries too much.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"What are you doing here?",	"s_23":"It's you again.",	"s_24":"I saw this scout walker get blown up. Thought I would check it for survivors.",	"s_26":"Uh... sure. Did you find any?",	"s_27":"Yea. Why are you still here.",	"s_28":"Just thinking about those soldiers that were in this thing.",	"s_29":"You're concerned?",	"s_30":"Of course, nobody deserves to die to Tuskens.",	"s_31":"Well, that's what happened.",	"s_32":"You found them?",	"s_33":"What's left of them is down the hill in those Tusken tents.",	"s_34":"They're dead?",	"s_35":"Yea, all of them.",	"s_36":"I see.",	"s_38":"No, I didn't even find any bodies. I think the Tuskens might have them.",	"s_40":"So what are you going to do now?",	"s_42":"Nothing. I'm not stupid enough to attack a Tusken camp. I'm heading back.",	"s_44":"Good call. Take it easy on the way back.",	"s_46":"Yea, you too.",	"s_48":"Don't give me that, Syndil told me you blew it up in your starfighter.",	"s_50":"What does she know? She's not exactly the swiftest speeder in the race, if you know what I mean.",	"s_52":"You're the one that told her, what does that make you?",	"s_54":"I didn't tell her anything. She makes stuff up. I'm certainly not going to attack a scout walker and become a fugitive.",	"s_56":"Well, you're here. The wreckage is here. Seems pretty cut and dried.",	"s_58":"Delusions. Sun-baked delusions, pal. I'm out of here. Good luck with those Tuskens down there.",	"s_60":"What a hero.",	"s_62":"Better than a corpse.",	"s_64":"Just searching the wreckage for survivors.",	"s_66":"What happened to it?",	"s_68":"No clue."
