I owe you my life %NU. What can I do to even slightly repay my debt to you?",	"s_102":"I'm looking for a friend of mine, a missing pilot... well smuggler.",	"s_104":"You will have to be a bit more specific, why did you come here to find him? Is he a Wookiee?",	"s_106":"No but I have information that these slavers wanted him dead.",	"s_108":"I think I know what you're talking about. I overheard the slavemaster talking about a smuggler interfering in their business. They said he was smuggling slaves for some of the other Trandoshan clans, the ones that struck a deal with the Empire.",	"s_110":"He was smuggling slaves? Are you sure?",	"s_112":"If we are talking about the same pilot, then yes.",	"s_114":"And the Empire is assisting the slavers capture Wookiees?",	"s_116":"Yes. Not this particular clan though but many of the others. That's why they were so upset and wanted him dead I think.",	"s_118":"Alright. Well thank you. You sure you will be alright from here?",	"s_120":"I'm the one that's grateful my friend. I will be fine; I know where to go for help from here.",	"s_122":"The Empire couldn't possibly be helping these scums?",	"s_124":"Well not these ones in particular but yes, the Empire is trying to wrest control of my home planet and are using the Trandoshans, I'm sure of it.",	"s_126":"And they said this pilot was smuggling slaves?",	"s_128":"If we are talking about the same pilot, then yes, it appeared that way.",	"s_130":"Alright, you'll be okay from here?",	"s_132":"Yes I will be fine; I know where to go for help from here. Thank you again my friend.",	"s_134":"We have to keep moving.",	"s_136":"You have done everyone a great service by ridding the galaxy of that monster! Now please, help me escape this place!",	"s_138":"What's in it for me?",	"s_140":"I... I don't have anything. Please though, if we make it out of here, anything I can help with, I will.",	"s_142":"There was a pilot these slavers wanted to kill. Know anything about that?",	"s_144":"Yes! I know some things about that, but I won't tell you anything unless you take me out of here!",	"s_146":"Fine, let's go.",	"s_148":"Thank you, I owe you my life if we make it out of here.",	"s_150":"And I won't take you out of here unless you tell me.",	"s_152":"Please, you have to get out of here anyway.",	"s_154":"I suppose but you better have some good information.",	"s_156":"It... it should be. Thank you.",	"s_158":"I'd rather just try and find what I'm looking for. You're on your own.",	"s_160":"You're no better than the slavers!",	"s_162":"Alright, let's go.",	"s_164":"Thank you. If we make it out of here, I will never forget this.",	"s_166":"Who... who are you?",	"s_168":"Never mind that. What are you doing with the Trandoshans?",	"s_170":"I'm a prisoner here... I've been tortured by these despicable Trandoshans for weeks now. Please help me.",	"s_172":"We're here looking for someone. Who are you?",	"s_174":"I'm Arrworr. I was captured by these slavers some time ago and have been tortured here since. Please, you have to help me get out of here.",	"s_176":"Please... no more. I can't take it...",	"s_96":"",	"s_98":"I'm fine now %NU. Take care of yourself; I'm sure we'll meet again."
