Speak with the starport master and ask for the shipping schedule for the transport delivering my shipment.",	"s_101":"Go speak to my assistant, Abagga Creel, and ask her for the shipment invoice. Also, speak with the starport master and ask for the shipping schedule for the transport delivering my shipment.",	"s_102":"You have the shipping schedule, but I still need the shipment invoice. Go speak to my assistant, Abagga Creel, and ask her for it.",	"s_103":"Excellent and good work. Let me take a look at these. Hmmm... this is odd. There's a crate in this shipment with no identification. I do not know what that could be or why it is in my shipment. While I look into this, I ask that you launch into Corellia space and trace the route flown by the transport delivering the shipment. Maybe you'll find a clue as to what happened.",	"s_104":"Understood. I'll launch into Corellia space.",	"s_105":"I don't think I'm interested. But good luck.",	"s_106":"Thank you. Return and report anything out of the ordinary to me.",	"s_107":"Very well. I'll try to pursue this on my own.",	"s_108":"You didn't find anything? Nothing at all? Would you please go look again? I just know there must be some clue as to what happened out there. Maybe the transport broke down. Or was attacked. Please look again and be sure to fly the entire route.",	"s_109":"Attacked by Ragtags? Those thugs who plague the planet? And amid the debris of what looked like the destroyed engines of large freighter or transport, no less. Very interesting.",	"s_110":"Okay, I'll go look again.",	"s_111":"I don't think so. I'm done with this.",	"s_112":"Thank you. Be sure to fly the entire route.",	"s_113":"Very well. I probably should not ask so much of someone I barely know.",	"s_114":"Did you discover anything about the strange crate in your shipment?",	"s_115":"Indeed I did. A low level employee in my warehouse named Tomi Jinsin has been accessing shipment records and adding something to deliveries from time to time over the past few months. Adding things like this unexplained crate. He's been fairly obvious about it. If I'd been paying more attention, I'd have likely noticed sooner. It's odd in a way. Almost like he wanted me to discover what he was doing.",	"s_116":"Why would he do that?",	"s_117":"Hmm? Oh, it's probably nothing. I'm sure he was just careless. In any case, we must find Tomi Jinsin. Unfortunately, I do not have any record of where he might live. But I suspect there must be some connection with these Ragtags. Maybe if you put some pressure on those thugs, they'll reveal what they know about Tomi. Seems like our best bet at this juncture.",	"s_118":"That's a good idea. I'll go intimidate some Ragtags.",	"s_119":"No thanks. I think I've had enough of this.",	"s_120":"You'll find Ragtags outside of most Corellia cities and Coronet is no exception. They're usually loitering around on the outskirts of the city. If you find anything about Tomi or my missing shipment, please follow it through.",	"s_121":"I understand. Those Ragtags are likely to get violent. I don't blame you for stepping away.",	"s_122":"Go to that bunker where Tomi is hiding and make him explain to you what is going on with all this.",	"s_123":"You defeated Tomi? Well, I suppose it would come to that sooner or later. If you would, please, go to the capitol and find out if my shipment is really there. I cannot imagine why it would be at the capitol building.",	"s_124":"The missing shipment was at the capitol building? Unbelievable. I'll send some droids to go retrieve it. And the mystery crate contained spice? I'm astounded. Why in the world would a smuggled crate of spice end up at the capitol building? You don't think this involved the Diktat, do you? No, that's patently absurd, isn't it?  I'll have to alert CorSec of all this. Not that there's much they can do at this point. Thank you, though, for your help!",	"s_125":"It was my pleasure.",	"s_126":"You did a wonderful job. I have an opening in my warehouse if you're...no, what am I saying. That position is far beneath someone like you. But you do have my thanks. And now I must get back to making my starships.",	"s_155":"Go pressure some Ragtags into revealing where to find Tomi Jinsin. You should be able to find some on the outskirts of the city. They are usually loitering around and harassing people.",	"s_156":"Welcome! I cannot thank you enough for your assistance. Thank you once again!",	"s_159":"Launch into space and trace the route taken by the transport that was to deliver my shipment. Return to me when you've completed that and report anything out of the ordinary that happens.",	"s_160":"Oh my, it looks like you already have a mission for space. Talk to me again when you've completed it and are ready for a new space mission.",	"s_198d9a41":"Greetings and welcome to Coronet. I apologize, but I don't have time to chat right now. If you'll excuse me.",	"s_47":"What's the problem?",	"s_48":"I need the route information again.",	"s_49":"Very well. I will transfer the information to you now.",	"s_4a019574":"Greetings and welcome to Coronet. I apologize for my fading enthusiasm, but I've been waiting for quite some time for a shipment of goods to arrive. These two shipwrights have been waiting with me, and one of them is becoming especially belligerent.",	"s_53":"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but it appears you don't have a ship. Here take this one, I don't need it anymore, and it should be more than adequate for your needs.",	"s_54":"Thank you, I will make good use of it.",	"s_57":"Very well. Here is the information.",	"s_80e2ba26":"Why are they waiting with you?",	"s_82cd91e":"They ordered some parts from me, and those parts should be in the missing shipment. I gave them a good price, but the long wait seems to have eroded their goodwill.",	"s_89":"I wish I could do something to help.",	"s_8ae971c3":"Thank you for the kind words. It's more important than you might realize. I've put all of my available funds into this shipment. Without it I cannot complete my starships and uphold the construction contracts for them. I could lose everything.",	"s_91":"Maybe you can. You could help me track down my missing shipment. If you're able to find it, then not only will I be able to fulfill the order these two gentlemen placed, but I'll also be able to complete construction on my own starships.",	"s_92":"What would I need to do?",	"s_94":"To start, go speak with my assistant, Abagga Creel, and get a shipment invoice for the missing shipment. She's at our office building here in Coronet. Also, speak to the starport master and get a shipping schedule for the transport that was supposed to make the delivery.",	"s_96":"Okay, I'll do it.",	"s_97":"No thanks. I'm not interested.",	"s_98":"Thank you! Return to me when you have both the invoice and the schedule.",	"s_99":"I understand. Hopefully it'll arrive soon anyway.",	"s_d48167e1":"That's too bad. I hope your goods arrive soon."
