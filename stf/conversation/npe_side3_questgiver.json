They are fragile.",	"s_16":"Yes. It wasn't easy to get, but here it is.",	"s_17":"Wonderful! I'll get to work on it right away. I want to find out who is trying to destroy the station.",	"s_18":"True. Be careful with them!",	"s_19":"Other than the Hutts?",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"That's the obvious answer, isn't it? But I'm not convinced that they are the only suspects. Someone else could be using their attack as a cover.",	"s_21":"Talk to Loche. I think he is also pursuing the possible sabotage.",	"s_23":"You brought those droid memory modules in, right?",	"s_25":"Yes. Is there a problem?",	"s_27":"Yes. The modules showed that there was some kind of sabotage to them, but the saboteur covered his (or her) tracks pretty well. I'm going to need an intact central processing core.",	"s_29":"How do I get an intact core?",	"s_31":"You are going to have to disable one of the droids and then check the core. It won't be easy, I'm sorry to say.",	"s_33":"How will I know if I have an intact core?",	"s_35":"I'll adjust your datapad to scan for one when one of the droids ceases to function. Once you get a core, bring it back to me.",	"s_43":"Ok! I'll come back with the core.",	"s_44":"Thank you!  I'll be here.",	"s_48":"Yes, but I can't talk right now.",	"s_50":"Ok. I'll find someone else to help me with my work.",	"s_52":"I am a little busy right now. Loche may have something that you can do.",	"s_53":"No thanks. Those droids are scary!",	"s_54":"You won't get far in this galaxy if fear guides your actions.",	"s_55":"I'll keep my eyes open.",	"s_56":"Thanks."
