		"s_fadd1b3c":"Nothing at the moment, pilot. I will let you know if anything shows up.",		"s_f98be94d":"I don't want to mess with Nym.",		"s_f918e086":"Acknowledged, %NU. Please comm us when we can be of further service.",		"s_f478139":"Repairs complete, %TU. 25% of your ship's damage has been fixed. Thank you for visiting the Royal Security Forces Naboo Station.",		"s_f3b40ad6":"Hmm, yes it does indeed seem that you have the correct permissions.

He's got a tight crew and is clever. The Empire wants to show the Rebels that they are not untouchable anywhere though. So, they are sending in solo pilots to disrupt Rebel operations in the system.",		"s_e331a0a5":"I knew I could count on you! Let me patch you through to the freighter's emergency broadcast. Good luck, pilot!",		"s_decdd151":"You have entered Naboo space, under the protection of the Royal Security Forces.

Thank you for visiting the Royal Security Forces Naboo Station.",		"s_c9361653":"Enjoy your stay in Kaadara, %NU.",		"s_c6aaa6b3":"Of course, Sir! Let me know when you are ready.",		"s_c42b6203":"Theed Starport.",		"s_c358d041":"(Request Repairs)",		"s_c295eda3":"Excellent, pilot. The Rebels think they are safe in the Karthakk system since they have a fragile alliance with the space pirate Nym. The Empire doesn't want to risk a full out assault on the system. Nym is quite powerful for a pirate and they have enough trouble fighting the Rebels right now.",		"s_c1ae5dd1":"An Imperial freighter is under attack by the Rebel filth and needs help right away, but I can't seem to get in touch with the Imperial space station.",		"s_bece5a73":"This sounds too complicated.",		"s_be07ed49":"Acknowledged, %TU.

Theed Starport is awaiting your arrival.",		"s_8845528b":"Kaadara Starport.",		"s_8460cdcf":"Before I do anything, I need repairs.",		"s_81db3c91":"Won't Nym be angry?",		"s_7f991ab5":"This station will charge a fee of %DI credits to fix half of your ship's damage. Are you ready to transfer the funds?",		"s_7e7609c1":"Nym is an honorable man, for a pirate at least. So far he's only seen these attacks as a challenge. He seems to think that if the Rebels can't handle a single pilot, they are weak. So, if you want I can connect you with the Imperial station and you can get started.",		"s_7cffc9b4":"Acknowledged, %TU. Moenia Starport is awaiting your arrival.",		"s_72a90512":"Of course I'm allowed to land there!",		"s_70876928":"All of it.",		"s_6bbe88b4":"Kaadara Starport (Imperial Pilot Trainer).",		"s_67f72920":"This station will charge a fee of %DI credits to repair all of the damage to your ship.

Head for the Karthakk system. An Imperial commander will contact you near Lok.",		"s_4468336c":"Half of it.",		"s_43af1e95":"Ok, %NU. Please comm us if this station can be of service.",		"s_41f82cf5":"Enjoy your stay in Moenia, %NU.",		"s_3bf3c89f":"What's the emergency?",		"s_3b9f150e":"Repairs complete, %TU. 50% of your ship's damage has been fixed. Thank you for visiting the Royal Security Forces Naboo Station.",		"s_390e6f9a":"Enjoy your stay in Theed, %NU.",		"s_382e612d":"What? Oh... very well.
