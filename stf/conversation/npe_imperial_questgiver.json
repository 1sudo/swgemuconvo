Is there something I can help you with?",	"s_15":"Are you an Imperial Officer?",	"s_16":"Welcome back, %NU. Do you have what I asked for?",	"s_18":"Not enough of a disguise? No matter. You are a loyal citizen of the Empire, are you not? My senior officer, Captain Thrawn, has a mission of the utmost importance.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"I would be happy to serve the Empire.",	"s_22":"Very good. We have an 'arrangement' with the Rak'qua on Station Gamma which seems to have gone sour. They put a lock on our communication system, which prevents us from communicating with our main fleet. Go there and extract the lockout information from one of their databanks with the code that I'll give you.",	"s_24":"I'll go there now.",	"s_26":"Good. You can reach the station in a starship. If you don't have one, Serissu can help you.",	"s_28":"I'm...uh...in the middle of something right now. Sorry.",	"s_30":"I see. Not as loyal as I thought you were.",	"s_31":"Yes. I have it right here.",	"s_32":"I don't have it yet.",	"s_33":"Very good. I will study the information and find out how they locked our communications. They will pay dearly for this. You may yet be a great asset to the Empire.",	"s_34":"Thank you.",	"s_35":"Now move along and let me work. I have some days to ruin.",	"s_36":"I hope to see good things from you, %NU.",	"s_37":"Then stop bothering me.",	"s_39":"I'd like to help, but I'm too busy right now.",	"s_41":"Too busy to serve the Empire? I'm surprised, citizen.",	"s_43":"Nothing, just admiring your uniform.",	"s_45":"Thank you, but please admire it from elsewhere.",	"s_48":"I need a skilled operative. When you are done training, I may have work for you."
