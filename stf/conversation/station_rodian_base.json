What've you got?",	"s_185":"I have an outstanding deal for you, my friend. See, the Gotal Bandits have been a problem for us ever since we came to Kashyyyk. No idea why they picked a fight with us... I don't think they have respect for anything!",	"s_186":"And?",	"s_188":"Master Sordaan would really enjoy seeing the Gotals lose a significant portion of their fighting force! You get me? You think you can help us with this problem?",	"s_189":"You got it!",	"s_190":"What's in it for me?",	"s_191":"No thanks.",	"s_192":"You'll be back!",	"s_193":"This is an excellent credit opportunity for a pilot such as you. What do you say to three hundred cred per kill... and a tiny bit of my respect when you're finished?",	"s_194":"Don't let me down, pilot!",	"s_195":"I'll take it.",	"s_196":"You can do better than that.",	"s_197":"Maybe I can do better than you?",	"s_198":"Good! Don't let me down, pilot!",	"s_199":"Hmm. I don't have anything for you right now. For better or for worse, we only hire Civilian Protection Guild pilots. They're the only ones we can trust.",	"s_200":"You can trust me!",	"s_201":"Oh, I'm sure. However, I can't offer contracts to any pilot who has yet to prove themselves as a strong Civilian Protector. Sorry about that.",	"s_202":"",	"s_203":"How do I become a Civilian Protector?",	"s_204":"What? You're breaking up! Come closer if you want to do business!",	"s_207":"The Kashyyyk space station is run by a Civilian Protector named Rian Ry. Work with her for a while. When she runs out of errands for you, stop by and we'll talk.",	"s_209":"I will.",	"s_211":"Rodian Protectors out.",	"s_578":"Acknowledged. This is Rodian Security Command. You here to do business with Sordaan?"
