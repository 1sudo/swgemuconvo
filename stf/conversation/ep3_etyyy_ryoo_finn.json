I wish I had it, but at least he gives me some now and then.",	"s_1197":"Please find my salt. Please.",	"s_1203":"Argh. Who are you? What? Who? Oh man. I really need some salt. Johnson sent you? Good. No wait, that's bad. Why's he checking up on me? No, no. It doesn't matter. ",	"s_1205":"You seem agitated. What's the problem?",	"s_1207":"Oh man. I lost my stash. Why am I telling you this? Oh wait. Maybe you can help me. Would you go get my stash for me? It's just salt.",	"s_1209":"Sorry to bother you.",	"s_1211":"No bother. No bother. Bye.",	"s_1213":"I don't know why I agreed to come here. I don't have a problem with salt. Really, I don't. Okay, maybe I like it more than some, but what's the harm? Tell me that. What's the harm?",	"s_1214":"Sure, I'll do that. Where is it?",	"s_1215":"Not now. Maybe later.",	"s_1216":"I was wandering outside of camp. I mean, I couldn't let Jerrol see me with salt. He'd all yell at me or something. But I got too close to the mouf dens. Some of the moufs came after me, and I dropped my salt when I ran away. Could you go get it for me?",	"s_1217":"Okay. Okay. Come back if you change you're mind. I could sure use that salt.",	"s_1218":"I'll go try and find it.",	"s_1219":"No thanks. Maybe another time.",	"s_1220":"Okay. Okay. Come back if you change you're mind. I could sure use that salt.",	"s_1221":"Oh really good. It should be somewhere among the mouf dens to the west. I was running all over the place trying to escape, so I'm sorry I can't give a better location.",	"s_1222":"Please find my salt. Please. Oh please."
