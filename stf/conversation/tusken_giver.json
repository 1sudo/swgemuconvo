I need these items to complete my research.",	"s_22":"Yes, but there was a problem.",	"s_23":"What problem? You weren't caught were you?",	"s_24":"Well... Yes. We should be okay, right?",	"s_25":"Oh dear. This is not good. You should go talk to Kav Goldor, he is our militia commander. The Tuskens may be on their way here now.",	"s_26":"I need the location again. I seem to have lost it.",	"s_28":"Fine, here you go. Don't disappoint me.",	"s_30":"You seem like a sturdy one. Can you help me with something?",	"s_32":"What is it?",	"s_34":"I am a scholar of some renown, have you heard of me?... No, well that's fine. That will change soon enough.",	"s_36":"Get to the point.",	"s_38":"I have been studying the Tuskens for some time now, and I have discovered they have some items, that they seem to feel are quite mystical. I would like to study these items.",	"s_4":"What are you doing here? Go see the Kav Golder. It may already be too late.",	"s_40":"And you want me to get them for you?",	"s_42":"Yes, but please don't get caught. We don't need them knowing who took them. We can find a way to return them later.",	"s_44":"I am not worried about some primitive warrior. Where are they?",	"s_46":"They have recently hid them in a cave to the west of Fort Tusken. Here are the coordinates. Please hurry back.",	"s_48":"I am far too busy to be bothered by someone like you.",	"s_6":"Do you have the relics?"
