Come back when you do.",	"s_12":"So, you're an officer, eh? That's how they're making em these days, hmm? Fine. We'll do what we can.",	"s_14":"There's something you want me to do?",	"s_16":"Right. If you're going to lead soldiers into battle, then you've got to know about battle. So what I want is for you to get yourself in a fight.",	"s_18":"Fine. I'm ready.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Ready, are you? We'll see about that. Just follow the instructions I've given you, and we'll see just how ready you are.",	"s_22":"With who?",	"s_24":"Does it matter? Course not. Fightin's fightin. There ain't much more to it. But since you seem to be set on having a specified enemy, try the Krayt Cultists.",	"s_26":"What's wrong with me?",	"s_28":"I didn't say there was anything wrong with you, did I? No, I didn't! That's the problem, people don't listen anymore.",	"s_30":"Sorry. Man, you're quick tempered.",	"s_32":"I'm old. Chalk it up to that.",	"s_34":"What did you want?",	"s_4":"Sorry, you're not the kind of person I'm looking to speak to. I only deal with officers. If you're planning to become a real officer someday, maybe you should wait until you're ready.",	"s_6":"You did good work. Very good work.",	"s_8":"Finished, eh? I knew you'd do it. You have it in you, that spark. I can see it. I always know."
