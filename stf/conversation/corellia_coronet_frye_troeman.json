I'm not paying that fraud! He had my terminal for maybe five minutes, connected a single wire and then it started working again. I could have done that myself! I'm not paying a single credit.",	"s_15":"I'm afraid I must insist that you pay.",	"s_16":"Oh, you're looking to threaten me into paying, eh? Fine. If you'll do me a quick favor, I'll pay. Go meet one of my suppliers for me and bring back the equipment he's...um...supplying for me. I'll upload coordinates for where you should meet him to your datapad.",	"s_17":"You tried to have me killed.",	"s_18":"Yeah, yeah. Things are tough all over. You looking for work as a lackey by any chance? If you decide you are, come back and talk to me. Seriously. As a show of good faith, here's that fraud's money. But tell him I know he's a fraud.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"You know, when I was working my way to the massive fortune I now have, people were always trying to hold me back. But they were losers. I'm a winner. That's why I'm the industrial tubing king of Coronet.",	"s_4":"Okay, okay. So I tried a little offense, and it failed. You know, it's hard to find good lackeys these days.",	"s_8":"What could someone like you possibly want from me? A handout? Not likely. Scram."
