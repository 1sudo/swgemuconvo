We, the Myyydril, do not like strangers. I have to wait for my daughter to return. [Attiera turns away.]",	"s_489":"Have you seen my daughter? She hasn't come back yet! I fear for the worst. Please... [Attiera begins to cry.]",	"s_515":"She's lost? Out there?",	"s_516":"Yes. She just went out to play. I'm such a horrible mother. She said she wouldn't go far! [Attiera sobs.]",	"s_517":"I'll help you find her.",	"s_518":"I hope she comes home soon.",	"s_519":"You will? I'd be.. you have no idea how grateful I'd be. Please look for her.

I'm so grateful. I had almost lost hope, but you've brought the light back into my life! Please take this.",	"s_525":"Your thanks is enough.",	"s_526":"Please, I insist. You've done so much for our people lately.",	"s_527":"[Attiera nods with respect.] Things have returned to normal. Froera is enjoying her Luilris Pies again. Everything seems to be going well. I hope things are going well with you too.",	"s_528":"They are, thank you for asking.",	"s_529":"I almost wish I had another problem for you to help me with, but I don't. If I do in the future, you'll be the first one I seek out."
