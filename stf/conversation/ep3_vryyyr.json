Are you here for an honorable hunt or are you here to spread the evil of the Empire?!",	"s_456":"I am a hunter.",	"s_458":"You're not a hunter until you have stalked the wilds of Kachirho, survived the terrors of Etyyy, and met the challenge of the Rryatt Trail!",	"s_460":"Kachirho? You mean this city?",	"s_462":"The city can be dangerous if you make the wrong friends... but, no. I mean the outskirts of this city. The thick forest that embraces Kachirho is filled with cunning beasts! Powerful! Dangerous!",	"s_464":"Thank you.",	"s_466":"Farewell.",	"s_468":"What is this Rryatt Trail?",	"s_470":"So you have the courage to face it? Good. But, courage isn't enough! You'll need true skill! ",	"s_472":"I have the skill!",	"s_474":"Then don't waste your time talking to me 'hunter!' Go to the Rryatt Trail! Find Achonnko, master trail guide of the Rryatt trail. A consummate hunter!

You watch your mouth!",	"s_486":"Perhaps I should rip your mouth right out of your face, outsider?!",	"s_488":"The Empire is doomed to fall!",	"s_490":"You have the courage to stand up to the Empire? Then perhaps you have what it takes to hunt on Kashyyyk after all."
