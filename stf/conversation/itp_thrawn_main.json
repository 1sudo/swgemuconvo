Go investigate the crash site and recover what you can.",	"s_22":"Rori? I'm on my way.",	"s_25":"Waste no time. Do not let any of the important documents fall into Rebel hands.",	"s_26":"No thank you.",	"s_28":"Well done. I do not impress easily.

You should speak with him.",	"s_30":"Very well.",	"s_32":"I've learned of a manufacturing shop where Rebel starships are being repaired.
