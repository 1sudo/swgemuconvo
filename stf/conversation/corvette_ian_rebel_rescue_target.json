Let's get off this thing first.",		"s_7ed61042":"I'm glad to see you guys. I've been trying to work out a escape plan ever since they got me on this vessel but they have kept a close eye on me.

I know of a Rebel safe haven that's not too far from here. I'll take an escape pod to there. Thank you again.",		"s_2960a6e2":"Adar Tallon put together a plan for us.
