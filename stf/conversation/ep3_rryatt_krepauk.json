All of Kashyyyk honors your accomplishments.",	"s_311":"You will find the katarn in the darkest depths of the Rryatt Trail. Have courage. Return to me when you have killed a katarn.",	"s_313":"You are truly a masterful hunter to have successfully killed a prey such as those minstyngar. You have but one trial remaining, but it is by far the most perilous. Your last hunt is to kill a katarn. The katarn is one of the most feared creatures on all of Kashyyyk. To defeat one, you will need all of your wits and skills at their peak. And a few friends to help as well.",	"s_315":"I'll do it.",	"s_317":"You will find the katarn in the darkest depths of the Rryatt Trail. Have courage. Return to me when you have killed a katarn.",	"s_319":"No thank you.",	"s_321":"Many before you have refused to hunt the katarn. And few return from such a hunt unscathed. Should you wish to try the hunt, please return and speak with me again.",	"s_323":"You will find these minstyngar on the lowest level of the Rryatt Trail. You are hunting minstyngar bloodspillers, minstyngar deathcallers, and minstyngar bonecrushers and only those. Kill 24 of them and return to me when the hunt is done.",	"s_325":"Thank you. Bringing peace to those feral Wookiees was a painful, but necessary task. Your next hunt is the most dangerous yet. You will hunt minstyngar on the lowest level of the Rryatt Trail. The minstyngar that are your targets are minstyngar bloodspillers, minstyngar deathcallers, and minstyngar bonecrushers. Do not take these creatures lightly for they are formidable prey.",	"s_327":"I'll do it.",	"s_329":"You will find these minstyngar on the lowest level of the Rryatt Trail.

If such is not the case, please speak with me again when you are ready for this hunt.",	"s_335":"Please send 24 feral Wookiees to the peaceful slumber of their final rest. You will find these Wookiees on the fourth level of the Rryatt Trail. Return to me once you are finished.",	"s_337":"Urootar was a powerful foe. You have done well to defeat him. For your next hunt, I ask you to cleanse the Rryatt Trail of feral Wookiees. The terrors of the Rryatt Trail proved to be too much for these Wookiees, and they reverted to a primitive, animal-like state. Please cleanse the trail of these feral Wookiees and in doing so, give those Wookiees an end to their suffering. ",	"s_339":"I'll do it.",	"s_341":"Thank you.

Return to me once you have defeated him.",	"s_349":"Very good. You have completed the walluga skullsmasher hunt. Next, I ask of you to defeat the crazed former jedi who is hiding on the Rryatt Trail. His name is Urootar. He is dangerous and not welcome on the trail. Please go defeat him.",	"s_351":"I'll do it.",	"s_353":"You will find Urootar somewhere on the second level of the Rryatt Trail. He still knows some tricks with the force, so please be cautious. Return to me once you have defeated him.",	"s_355":"No thank you.",	"s_357":"Very well. speak with me again if you change your mind.",	"s_359":"You will find walluga skullsmashers further along the trail on this level. Hunt 16 of them and then return to me.",	"s_361":"Greetings and welcome to the Rryatt Trail. As an important part of Kashyyyk tradition, Wookiees come to the trail to prove themselves as warriors. Would you like to undertake some of the trial of the Rryatt Trail?",	"s_363":"Yes, tell me more.",	"s_365":"To show that you are an accomplished warrior, you must defeat some of the fierce denizens of the Rryatt Trail. First, I would like you to hunt walluga skullsmashers. Kill 16 of them and then return to me.",	"s_368":"I'll do it.",	"s_370":"You will not have to descend any deeper into the Rryatt Trail to find walluga skullsmashers.
