On his brothers too. ",	"s_2":"",	"s_29":"I wonder how long I'm going to have to wait here.",	"s_30":"So Bossk plans to collect that bounty?",	"s_31":"Well, actually Bossk also said that there's a much larger bounty on Lucien. He intends to force Hraykken and Draykken to handle Lucien for him so he can collect that much more substantial bounty. If they do that, he said he'll let Louis go.",	"s_33":"I am.",	"s_34":"Someone took him. A big trandoshan. I think his name was Box. Or Bosch. Or, no, I got it...it was Bossk. He said he as a bounty hunter. He took Louis.",	"s_37":"If you find Louis, please ask him to let me know what I'm waiting for?",	"s_51":"You don't think Bossk will try to collect both bounties?",	"s_52":"Lucien is the one who put the bounty on Louis and his brothers. If Lucien is out of the picture, then there's no way for him to pay the bounty.",	"s_54":"I'm guessing it will be up to me to go take care of Lucien.",	"s_56":"Hraykken and Draykken would probably send you to do it anyway. Bossk told me where to find him. It's nearby.",	"s_58":"Thank you.",	"s_60":"Oh, sure.",	"s_62":"Why didn't you go after Bossk and free Louis yourself?",	"s_64":"Louis told me to wait here.",	"s_66":"Wait here? For what?",	"s_68":"He didn't say.",	"s_8":"Are you looking for Louis? Louis Bender?"
