Mainly that they break down and they are impossible to sell.  If you are here to sell it, I am not interested.",	"s_12":"Actually I am hoping to reverse engineer it.",	"s_14":"Hah!  The first thing I would recommend changing is the Timer Mechanism.  The old models had a defective timer, probably affected by the extreme heat.  If you insulate the timer mechanism from the heat I bet it would help.",	"s_16":"What does the Timer Mechanism do exactly?  ",	"s_18":"The timer is manually set by the cook. It is usually used to avoid over cooking what ever is in the fryer.  If the timer is defective, not only will the food burn, but so will the oil.  Perhaps even the entire fryer and anything in the immediate area would also be damaged.",	"s_19":"Some great information.  Thank you.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"You might want to speak with Tombl Blaus. He was an old fryer assembly worker. Used to work in the factory on one or two of the parts for these things.",	"s_24":"Where would Tombl Blaus be located exactly?",	"s_25":"Here is his location. Good luck.",	"s_26":"Hello my name is Kerhi Hilak welcome to my humble shop.  Feel free to look around and ask questions.",	"s_4":"Hello my name is Kerhi hi-Lak welcome to my humble shop.",	"s_9":"Hi Kerhi hi-Lak, I was told that you might know something about this fryer?"
