Is there a problem?",	"s_423f3cd2":"My problems are my own, citizen. Just because my vacation was interrupted to comply with some vague orders I have not even received yet does not mean that I am going to share those problems with everyone who asks.",	"s_50bd5bd":"I apologize. I'll let you get back to your problems.",	"s_6efdcd5c":"You're on vacation?",	"s_988e6614":"I suppose I shall. Now move along, citizen.",	"s_a994429":"Was on vacation. Well, I still am technically. It's complicated, citizen. I await orders from my commanding officer. From what he told me, they are very important orders, though apparently not important enough to let me know what those orders would be. I think this is revenge for grading better than him in the carbine range last month. He can be so petty. But enough about that. I've said more than I intended.",	"s_dfbcbb1c":"My patience is thin, citizen. Why are you bothering an Imperial officer?",	"s_e3059e6a":"I see. Well, have fun with what's left of it, if you can.",	"s_e30fb52":"Good. Now move along, citizen."
