		"s_fd5402d8":"Ah! Then it should give you information about where to go to start your naval adventure. Good luck, my friend!",		"s_f3ec92a":"Use the planetary map to travel to the vendors listed on it, but not all vendors will be listed there. For the unlisted ones, you'll have to travel around looking for player-owned buildings that hold vendors. Once you've found a vendor, double-click it to see what it has for sale. You can also check bazaar terminals, but the listings on those will only be low-end starships and ship components, if even that.",		"s_f2a4df5e":"Good idea! Thanks.",		"s_efbaf135":"You're obviously not involved with the business of space flight, so I really don't have time for you. Good day.",		"s_ea1e27a2":"Pilot! Yes, you. Are you here on Imperial business? Are you the envoy from my commander? Actually, at second glance, you obviously are not. Very well. Carry on.",		"s_e843e3ab":"Use the command CTRL+V to open the planetary map. On the right side of your display, you will see a listing of trainers by category. All local trainers who register with the planet will appear on this list. Click the 'Trainer' tab and then look for a pilot trainer.",		"s_e30fb52":"Good. Now move along, citizen.",		"s_e3059e6a":"I see. Well, have fun with what's left of it, if you can.",		"s_e013f498":"Look for the flashing 'envelope' icon on your interface. It's placed on the lower right-hand side of your screen by default.",		"s_dfbcbb1c":"My patience is thin, citizen. Why are you bothering an Imperial officer?",		"s_df7992b9":"There are some freelance pilots here and there, though the Empire mostly frowns upon that kind of activity. At the same time, we do recognize that there is a need for a small number of freelance pilots to handle certain jobs with which the Empire does not want to be associated or simply views as beneath our notice. As I understand it, most freelance pilots are recruited through email.",		"s_d73d164f":"I am really not in the mood right now, so unless you're looking to enlist in the Imperial Navy, I suggest you leave.",		"s_d4c6e8cd":"No problem! Anything else?",		"s_cf5fc0f":"How do I repair my starship?",		"s_cdb17e79":"How do I check the planetary map?",		"s_cc7c9754":"Don't mention it. Anything else?",		"s_cb747ceb":"Hmm. Me neither. Maybe you should give it a little time?",		"s_c9e97ed5":"How else would I join up?",		"s_c4682ea6":"Thanks!",		"s_c095fa8d":"And why are you telling me this? I have enough problems to deal with at the moment, so I'm going to forget that you told me that.

Anything else?",		"s_bc9a0be":"Yeah, good luck with that. Anything else?",		"s_ba95f774":"Bazaar terminals are located all over major cities. Check the areas surrounding major hot spots like the starport, the bank, any of the cantinas, or even the hospitals.",		"s_b9b27823":"Thank you.",		"s_b641cda6":"Where can I find a bazaar terminal?",		"s_add31f19":"I need a starship.",		"s_acc368b1":"How do I join the Empire?",		"s_a994429":"Was on vacation. Well, I still am technically. It's complicated, citizen. I await orders from my commanding officer. From what he told me, they are very important orders, though apparently not important enough to let me know what those orders would be. I think this is revenge for grading better than him in the carbine range last month. He can be so petty. But enough about that. I've said more than I intended.",		"s_a9850aec":"I got an email from the Alliance!",		"s_9f7f7c0a":"I think that the majority of pilot trainers are registered with the planetary map. Try opening the planetary map with CTRL+V. On the right-hand side, there is a listing of categories. Look under 'trainer' to find any local pilot teacher who's looking for pupils.",		"s_98e32091":"Well, then could I ask some other questions?",		"s_988e6614":"I suppose I shall. Now move along, citizen.",		"s_8cf9be64":"Where can I find a vendor?",		"s_8b37a99a":"How do I make money?",		"s_8b23fac":"I want to learn to fly.",		"s_8515e448":"Yes. I have an email from the Imperial Navy.",		"s_7ce95581":"I am really not in the mood right now, so unless you're looking to enlist in the Imperial Navy, I suggest you leave. Quickly.",		"s_72352199":"Your best bet is to get in touch with the Empire and sign up for their training program. There are others who will urge you to put your efforts to use in the Alliance, but fools will be fools.

Anything else?",		"s_6f4ea30b":"Giving them out may not be the phrase I'd use, but the Empire will indeed supply new pilots with a ship. You can't exactly be an Imperial Pilot without a ship. I've also heard rumors that the Alliance has prepared a fleet of ships for their newly recruited pilots. They obviously want to get them into the fray as soon as possible, but rest assured that their fleet exists on borrowed time. We will crush it soon enough.",		"s_6efdcd5c":"You're on vacation?",		"s_6d792b3f":"Double-click on the envelope icon, and read your mail! Anything else you wanted to ask?",		"s_68cb68ff":"Is there anyone else I could fly for?",		"s_688d1dd9":"Lack of funds is a common issue for new pilots. That is why so many pilots start out working for someone else. Ever think of joining the military to get a starship?",		"s_5ff8baab":"I was wondering if you could answer some questions?",		"s_5e410744":"Right-click on the map location to create and activate a waypoint. Follow the waypoint to the trainer's location.",		"s_5989c487":"There are all sorts of civilian contracts available on the 'mission terminals' you find throughout town. Look for them near any major structure. Use the terminal to bring up the current list of local contracts. Choose the one that interests you most and you'll make money when the task is complete.",		"s_5618d2cd":"No. I have received no email.",		"s_558a361a":"The Imperial Navy? I've heard that they are sending out recruitment emails to everyone they can locate these days. Have you checked your email today?",		"s_542c6b63":"Do you really think you should be asking me that? Even if I did know that some Alliance pilots are bold enough to register their locations on the planetary map, I wouldn't exactly be telling people. Would I? I'm an officer in the Imperial Navy, after all.",		"s_52939a0":"How do I check my email?",		"s_50bd5bd":"I apologize. I'll let you get back to your problems.",		"s_495777c0":"Have you checked any vendors? Merchants use vendors to help sell their merchandise. Shipwrights put finished starships and ship components for sale on their vendors, and then you can go to those vendors and purchase what you need.",		"s_472f61d1":"Local space stations are the easiest way to get your ship repaired. When you are heading back here, you should stop at the space station and ask them for repairs. They will provide a quick estimate on what it will take to get you back on track.",		"s_423f3cd2":"My problems are my own, citizen. Just because my vacation was interrupted to comply with some vague orders I have not even received yet does not mean that I am going to share those problems with everyone who asks.",		"s_408909a3":"You seem distressed. Is there a problem?",		"s_332cd8bf":"You may consider yourself lucky that I have nothing else with which to occupy my time. What are your questions, citizen?",		"s_324c0132":"Fine. Unless there was something else you wanted to ask, please move along.",		"s_32146025":"Then what?",		"s_3059f369":"What then?",		"s_27186cee":"I don't have enough money.",		"s_270c87b2":"How do I get them to repair my ship?",		"s_21bf1a8c":"How do I join the Alliance?",		"s_17bc5d9b":"When you approach the space station, use SHIFT+C to target it and open communication with the commander. You will be asked if you want to purchase repairs or if you want to land on the planet.",		"s_144ec5cc":"Sounds good. Thanks!",		"s_12157feb":"The military gives out free ships?",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (greeter_kadaara_imperial_officer.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
