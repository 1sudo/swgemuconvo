I'm ready to destroy some droids! Or to send someone else in to destroy some.",	"s_30":"Wow, you really tore into those helper droids. I'm impressed. ",	"s_31":"The pleasure was all mine.",	"s_32":"Hmm...while your in such a destructive mood, I should send you to help my brother, Louis. He's planning to blow up some transports at a delivery depot on the outskirts of Kor Vella. He's not as good at blowing things up as I am, so he'll definitely need your help.",	"s_33":"With pleasure!",	"s_35":"Then we are in agreement. Destroy as many helper droids as you can. And do not overlook the helper droid queen. I don't know what her purpose is, but it cannot bring anything but darkness and chaos to our lives. Destroy her as well.",	"s_37":"There are more helper droids to destroy! Go, go, go.",	"s_8":"Did Hraykken send you? Good. This factory builds helper droids. These are the most evil droids ever known to the galaxy. They must be destroyed at once! That is where you come in. I'll man a command post here while you go destroy helper droids."
