Where did you find her! Never mind...I don't care. This is the best thing to happen since this nightmare started! Thank you, %TU!",	"s_31":"It's been a while since we have seen a survivor. Glad you found us.",	"s_32":"Actually I was sent here to deliver a radio.",	"s_33":"A radio? That is the best news I have heard since...uh, in a long time. Please hand it over.",	"s_34":"Yes?",	"s_53":"How did you get stuck in the quarantine zone?",	"s_64":"I happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time I guess. I was out extracting ore when I heard the first ugly.",	"s_65":"Ugly?",	"s_66":"That is what I call them...anyway, I could hear it scream...or growl...some sort of combination of the two. It was calling the others, calling for back up or something, while staring directly at me and drooling. It was 150 meters away but it was close enough to scare the daylights out of me...",	"s_67":"Okay...well, I have to g....",	"s_68":"Luckily for me, it was missing a foot. It tried to hobble toward me...it stuck it's stump in the ground and made this kind of squish sound hitting the compacted ground.",	"s_69":"OKAY! Heard enough, I'm going to go now.",	"s_70":"Betsy sensed a threat and lunged at the ugly.",	"s_71":"Wait. Who's Betsy?",	"s_72":"My Carrion Spat, Betsy. She knocked it on the ground and covered my retreat.  I ran up to some rocks and hid. Of course more showed up then and surrounded poor Betsy. Next thing I knew I was running away. I didn't stick around to watch...she was my best friend. Oh dear...Betsy didn't have a chance.",	"s_73":"Sorry for your loss.",	"s_74":"(SOB)"
