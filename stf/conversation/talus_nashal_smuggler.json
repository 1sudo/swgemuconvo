I don't agree with what our leader is doing to the Selonians. I think we can make a fine profit without having to exploit them.",	"s_12":"I am looking for some Selonian prisoners, maybe you could help me?",	"s_14":"Sure, you can check the cargo manifest database for their storage location. Here, use this password to gain access to the database.",	"s_15":"Get out of here! I've told you all I know.",	"s_16":"I'll leave when I get the codes to that shuttle.",	"s_18":"Thanks.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"That's not all. I know there is a traitor in the Selonian den. It's how our leader manipulates the Selonians. Tell the den mother that the Askura deal was fake. She will know what to do.",	"s_22":"I don't know what that means.",	"s_24":"Just tell the den mother. She will know what it means.",	"s_26":"Are you going to be ok here?",	"s_28":"No, which is why I'll be taking off at the first opportunity. The shuttle sitting on the landing pad will make an excellent ticket to a new life.",	"s_30":"You better leave. The guards around here shoot first and never ask questions.",	"s_6":"You're helping those Selonians, aren't you?",	"s_8":"Yes, I am."
