Anything to make that bucket head look bad.",	"s_174":"Make who look bad?",	"s_176":"G-5P0 of course! That devious little droid stole my job! I was well respected through out the galaxy for never erring in translating even the most peculiar of languages. How was I supposed to talk to a Ithorian that didn't know basic? I don't have two mouths!",	"s_178":"Okay okay, I understand.",	"s_180":"Sorry about that. Alright, I've compiled a disk with the basics for understanding and making yourself understood in Huttese. It should be enough for what you want to accomplish. It will be yours for a mere 20,000 credits!",	"s_182":"20,000 credits?! Are you insane?!",	"s_184":"< Walda laughs > That was a good one, you should have seen the look on your face! Here you go. < Walda hands you the disk > Be careful what you say to Jabba, he's got quite the temper.",	"s_186":"I hope that disk worked out for you. That metal head probably had circuits fry when he wasn't needed. < Walda laughs >",	"s_188":"You're not one of those metal heads are you? Well, what do you want?"
