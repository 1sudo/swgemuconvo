While it's true that we've found some peace with Mellichae as our prisoner, this planet has no end of threats to our new found prosperity. I, for one, shall not lower my guard.",	"s_5":"Tell me about the Nightsister headdress in the Adventurers' Guildhall.",	"s_6":"That headdress was taken from a Nightsister who wandered into town.
