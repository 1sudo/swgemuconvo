I don't recall your face.",	"s_12":"No. Mikfa Faaus suggested I come and ask you about this fryer.",	"s_14":"Oh dear me.  I am retired.  I haven't handled one of those things in a long time.  That looks as old as me.  Does it work?",	"s_16":"No it is broken.  I am trying to reverse engineer it.",	"s_18":"Oh.  Well in that case I might be able to help.  Obviously the fryer has a heating element that cannot be flammable and as well as not exceed the melting point of the fryer or the heating element itself.  It must of course be hot enough to bring the oil to a boiling point.",	"s_19":"Wow. Thank you.  Is there anything else you can tell me?",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Huh?  Who are you?  Were we just having a conversation?  Oh poodoo.  I recognize that model of fryer.  Kerhi Hilak used to sell those in her shop.  You should visit her and maybe she'll buy it.  That is what you wanted to do right?  Sell it?",	"s_24":"Uh yeah.  Where is Kerhi hi-Lak again?",	"s_25":"Here you go.",	"s_26":"Hello.  I am busy in the garden at the moment. Maybe you can come back later for tea.",	"s_4":"Hello.  I am busy in the garden at the moment. I wasn't expecting company.",	"s_9":"I am sorry Eteto I don't want to take too much of your time."
