For some reason they assaulted our village many days ago. We've been rebuilding and reinforcing our village ever since.",	"s_48fd623":"Speak to our new chief engineer, he is new and a bit frazzled.

I could help heal your soldiers.",	"s_8aa931e3":"Be careful, we've received information that the Sith Shadows will attack soon.",	"s_8c109ae0":"I am sure Sivarra will need all the help she can get.

I think they are looking to finish us off this time.",	"s_de1f69ee":"Well they are going to have a tough time with all the new defenses.",	"s_e0741a0c":"Captain Sarguillo has need of good soldiers like you. He's right over there.",	"s_e5a75b57":"Who are the Sith Shadows?",	"s_f24ae96":"I'm a crack shot with a blaster."
