I'm afraid I don't have time to chat. I must deal with this pilot, Lt. Herm, who is supposed to be on patrol.",	"s_79729876":"It is a military matter that is being handled. Of that, I assure you. The fact of the matter is that when the Empire tells one of its pilots to fly a patrol, then that pilot does so. Nothing else matters. I'm trying to convince Lt. Herm that it is best for him to remember that.",	"s_a438c9":"Yes, of course. Or something like that. But I'd rather avoid disciplinary action if possible. I believe that such actions reflect on me as a leader as well as on the person being disciplined. As such, I'm hopeful we can resolve this without Lt. Herm needing to be punished yet again.",	"s_ab68a343":"It seems that Lt. Herm does not care for space flight. Apparently he's not fond of heights in general. As it turns out, when he signed on to be a pilot, he thought he could drive an AT-ST. I'm beginning to doubt that he could handle even that.",	"s_d2849e62":"What's the problem?"
