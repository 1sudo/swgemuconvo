You really kicked those guys where it counts. Ready for round two?",	"s_106":"One more thing Rebel.

And pretty soon, you'll know the plan as well!",	"s_13835aab":"You don't have much time.",	"s_1551b284":"Something good?",	"s_156":"Why?",	"s_158":"What?",	"s_160":"I said, 'Why?'",	"s_162":"What am I, a mind reader? They're probably concerned about Alliance attacks.",	"s_164":"Then why send an Inquisitor? ",	"s_166":"Well, %TU, think about it. The Empire needs to know what the Alliance is planning. And no one is better at gathering information than an Inquisitor.",	"s_168":"Have you ever seen an Inquisitor up close?",	"s_16e3e795":"Your ship is waiting. Watch your back.",	"s_170":"Once...a long, long time ago. Let's not talk about it right now. I want you to kill that Inquisitor before he reaches the Imperial fleet in Dathomir.",	"s_172":"Are you crazy? No one can kill an Inquisitor!",	"s_174":"Don't talk back to me, junior! And don't be ridiculous! The Inquisitors are mortal, like the rest of us. Believe me, they CAN be killed. I know that for a fact. Now I want you to get out there, immediately!",	"s_178":"What?",	"s_1909d363":"You've got to get back out there. You realize what will happen if that Inquisitor gets a hold of your friends?",	"s_197c8928":"Happy to serve.",	"s_1af32f06":"Likely story. Why don't you just tell me that your dog ate your blasters?",	"s_1bb2f893":"They're using my men because they know every inch of Dathomir space. They'll run rings around those Imperials. I suggest you follow their every move. I trained them all myself.",	"s_1c669":"Well, no. Not exactly. . But we've managed to hit them pretty hard lately.",	"s_1c8bddbb":"What is it?",	"s_207":"I thought you would! Now you don't have to take the whole base apart. You're just going to pave the way for an Alliance B-Wing squadron. They've had their sights set on this base for a while. ",	"s_209":"Why is the Alliance sending pirates? This sounds like strictly a Rebel operation. ",	"s_211":"They're using my men because they know every inch of Dathomir space. They'll run rings around those Imperials. I suggest you follow their every move. I trained them all myself.",	"s_213":"You did?",	"s_21374155":"Remember what I said. They're just men.",	"s_215":"Sure! I wasn't ALWAYS an old man, you know. I used to have a few more marbles rolling around upstairs. Now go on; get out of here.",	"s_220":"Why?",	"s_2284c46":"Look, you don't have to like what we do. But those miners aren't hurting anybody. They're just trying to feed their families.

",	"s_268606ba":"They'll never know it was you.",	"s_272":"What do you mean?",	"s_2744b825":"What I mean, pliot, is that you are grounded until further notice. We can't trust YOU with any more missions.",	"s_277":"What have you got for me?",	"s_279":"Apparently, the Empire's had just about enough of our activities in the area. I don't know who they hate more, smugglers or Rebels.",	"s_281":"Same difference to them.",	"s_283":"You're probably right, %NU. We've received word that they're planning to build a space station in the Lok system. They'll use it to monitor all the activity in the area.",	"s_2846f47d":"Um, yes. Well, I'm here now.",	"s_285":"Sounds like a problem.",	"s_287":"Yep. A BIG one. We can't let them build that station. So here's the plan! We're going to destroy the station components while they're en route to Lok.",	"s_289":"Smart.",	"s_28d914fc":"Well listen up. We are dealing with several situations here, and I'd like to see what you can do. First of all, the Black Suns have been taking a lot of business from us lately. Nym doesn't like it. We need a pilot to send them a message. A LOUD message. Heh! ",	"s_291":"Of course it's smart! It was my idea. Now listen up. Your first objective is to find out what route those Imperial freighters plan to use. ",	"s_293":"How do I do that?",	"s_295":"You're going to kidnap one of their technical supervisors.

One of our men has raided an Imperial outpost on Dathomir and he walked away with plenty of loot. Now all he has to do is escape! Easier said than done, of course, as the Empire wants their things back. So you could escort our man out of Dathomir...",	"s_357":"Uh huh.",	"s_359":"What?!",	"s_35dd4aa2":"Yes, I know!",	"s_3609c810":"It is?",	"s_361":"Nothing!",	"s_363":"Don't smart off to me!",	"s_365":"I'm not!",	"s_367":"Here's some MORE good news.

Oh yes...you'll like this, it's a Rebel rescue mission! A Rebel fleet was carrying several scientists through the Dantooine system, they were ambushed by Imperial fighters! That's not right.

You'll make more money.",	"s_3b95cf2f":"I said, 'What is it?'!",	"s_3bcc34e7":"Oh no! You've got WORK to do, junior!",	"s_3bfd507c":"Let me know when you're ready for another mission.",	"s_3c546115":"Some other time? I'm really busy!",	"s_3dc78ada":"Sounds like he hasn't changed. Bleh. I spit on him.",	"s_400":"I'm not!",	"s_402":"Here's some MORE good news. Another group of our men infiltrated a number of Imperial troop transports in the Endor system.

So what's it going to be, junior?",	"s_410d920c":"Alright, let's do this!",	"s_421":"What skill am I to learn?",	"s_422":"I don't think you'll be of any use to anyone until you learn about hyper-maneuverable starfighters.",	"s_423":"Do you like guns? And engines? You'd better, because you're going to learn about heavy starship component use.",	"s_424":"A smarmy nerf-herder like yourself could probably make good use of some special weapons and tactics training.",	"s_425":"Since you don't seem to have any of your own, how about some DROID intelligence theory training.",	"s_426":"Alright.",	"s_427":"Calm down. Calm down. I don't think I've seen anyone so excited about starships.",	"s_428":"I like guns.",	"s_42880861":"Okay...",	"s_429":"Yeah, I BET you do.",	"s_42b12fa4":"I should hope not! Good grief!

You don't belong here!",	"s_4f755af2":"In my day, a pilot would NEVER leave a job unfinished!",	"s_50669846":"Apparently, the Empire's had just about enough of our activities in the area.

You helped us; now we'll help you.",	"s_5e0e14bc":"BECAUSE I just know, that's how! None of your business how I know! Young people today are so rude! Shut your trap and get back to work!",	"s_5e4c5d9a":"And now we have the chance to REALLY do some damage. And that's where you come in.",	"s_5fe6ae71":"Haha! You're joking, right?",	"s_60080304":"Not another Inquisitor assignment, I hope.",	"s_61485366":"It's not going to happen anytime soon.",	"s_6222b64d":"Do you have any missions that I could fly?",	"s_6318beeb":"What's the situation?",	"s_6429f86b":"Here's some MORE good news.

Go on, get out of here!",	"s_6561f20e":"Well then why aren't you DOING it? Get back out there!",	"s_6634adb9":"I don't have the answer to that one, pilot. But Admiral Burke requested you personally.",	"s_67e6df55":"Okay.",	"s_69a739e6":"Where do I find this guy?",	"s_6adec6b0":"Of course!",	"s_6f679fea":"What does it mean?",	"s_6fdab943":"Here's your duty pay. And let me know when you're ready for another mission! ",	"s_7052aaab":"I'll take it as it comes.",	"s_7065a3b":"Great.",	"s_7090182":"What?!",	"s_71f899d5":"It's about time you got here, pilot. Suit up.",	"s_73313039":"Really, I just want to work.",	"s_761dd18e":"I'm not in it for the money.",	"s_76c0ae11":"Hurry up! There's no time to waste! ",	"s_774fb2f0":"Eh? Who's that? Who are you? Tell me your faction!",	"s_77633b61":"Easy for you to say. They're not gunning for you.",	"s_77e48d5b":"What do you mean?",	"s_78b8ac8f":"Oh what is THIS. I told you to take out those freighters!",	"s_7ae51280":"You did?",	"s_7afc40b8":"Fine. Well the Alliance is feeling more confident, now that you've terminated that Inquisitor.",	"s_7ce1c24":"[exhale loudly]",	"s_7da3fc7a":"No. Those don't come along very often. ",	"s_7e579e1e":"I'm a privateer.",	"s_7e602d1b":"I'm not!",	"s_7fca522a":"You mean, will I quit the Rebellion and start working for Nym full time? Forget it. It'll never happen.",	"s_8057f803":"Then it won't take you too long to pack! The orders don't include any details, but I can only assume it involves some operation that his fleet is about to undertake. You had best be ready for a challenge, pilot.",	"s_81e25d24":"You showed them! Let's see the Empire try to build a station in THIS system!",	"s_8209f997":"Nothing I can repeat.",	"s_835acc11":"You think you're a hero or something? Fine! Go on! You'll find your scientists in the Dantooine system.",	"s_83f72ca3":"Something that will help the Rebellion. How does that sound to you?",	"s_840af840":"Lucky guess.",	"s_841d27db":"Why?",	"s_8450d7db":"Let me take a crack at disabling those troop transports.",	"s_84c908b8":"Eh? Who's that? You're no... wait, you ARE a Rebel pilot. But you don't fly with this unit. What are you doing here?",	"s_85fbc617":"Here's your duty pay. You've earned it.",	"s_86677c6b":"What does he want with me?",	"s_868699d3":"I don't give my pilots easy missions. But I DO pay them well. Here you go. See me later when you're ready for another mission.",	"s_86df2510":"Is that your idea of a comeback? Grow up! Get to work!",	"s_8729f60e":"Smart.",	"s_8762aa6e":"Crazy like a SQUALL! Don't underestimate me, %TU! I'm thinking, always thinking. I was smart enough to join this Alliance with the Rebels, wasn't I?",	"s_87d7e908":"I know.",	"s_87e30fff":"Not this time, my grumpy friend. This time, you'll be helping your beloved Rebellion.

What you need are SKILLS! And you've come to the right place. I grant skills. Even to fools like yourself!",	"s_8b4d636d":"Intel reports that the Emperor is sending an Inquisitor to Dathomir.",	"s_8cac3c56":"I thought you would! Now you don't have to take the whole base apart.

This sounds like strictly a Rebel operation. ",	"s_981faf84":"What did he say about me?",	"s_98588d70":"OK fine.",	"s_99069e90":"YES! It's ALWAYS serious when we're talking about Imperials!",	"s_9943289":"I want to help those scientists.",	"s_9976a72":"Get somebody else to do your dirty work! I need a break.",	"s_997f2d21":"But you said...",	"s_99d3b4fd":"What have you got for me?",	"s_9a01b8f2":"Once...a long, long time ago. Let's not talk about it right now.

See if I ever try to give you a mission again!",	"s_9d0a2207":"Should I target the Black Suns directly?",	"s_9e1c0119":"Yes, but the Rebels are being smart. They're deciding to strike now, while the iron is hot.",	"s_9e3df78d":"Is it your naptime? Well fine then!",	"s_9f50a13":"Back to those poor miners. They're outgunned; there's no way they can defend themselves. I want you to get out there and set up a defensive perimeter.",	"s_a04dd423":"Think of your future, junior! Someday you'll be a crazy old man like me. Do you still want to be working then?",	"s_a2c04cca":"Have you changed your mind?",	"s_a434ad25":"One more thing Rebel. All the missions I provide you with will be high risk missions and might be too much to handle by yourself.

Or do I have to explain it to you again?",	"s_a64a6f6f":"They're not gunning for YOU either, junior! Now stop moping. Let's get your mind off all this. I've got a mission for you.",	"s_a6e1a5f4":"That's because it's top secret! In the meantime, let's keep gunning for the Empire. You're going to Dathomir.

",	"s_b045a378":"Touche.",	"s_b0d064ef":"Endor it is! Leave immediately!",	"s_b1f1f364":"We could never hold our own against the Imperials. We needed your guns. And you needed us! A perfect situation.",	"s_b20c71fe":"It wasn't easy.",	"s_b45dc260":"Because it makes another Inquisitors angry - angry at ME. And that's trouble I don't need.",	"s_b4e09e44":"Duty pay, you nitwit! Here you go. And let me know when you're ready for another mission!",	"s_b607bb2e":"Yep. A BIG one. We can't let them build that station. So here's the plan!

So we need to help them out.",	"s_c985b91":"I said, 'Why?'",	"s_cb25bcd4":"Then let's get a move on, pilot. The Admiral is not going to want to wait all day for you to arrive. You are to report into him at Doaba Guerfel on Corellia. Keep your wits about and you just might learn something. Dismissed, pilot.",	"s_cb6eb294":"Aw shucks.",	"s_cbcfe001":"Well, whatever! You know what I mean. Don't be obstinate, junior!",	"s_ccac6a71":"You're going to Dathomir. I want you to join some of my men on a guerilla strike against an Imperial base.",	"s_cd445db2":"I like the sound of that.",	"s_ceb77d0c":"We've got the Empire on the run! Let's kick 'em while they're down!",	"s_d054f893":"I don't like targeting Inquisitors. You want to know why?",	"s_d06c9b96":"Even I don't know what the Alliance has planned.",	"s_d16ee99f":"Here's the situation. Intel reports that the Emperor is sending an Inquisitor to Dathomir.",	"s_d1be90a9":"What's the plan?",	"s_d318a2bb":"Back from your assignment with Admiral Burke, I see! I hope that everything went according to plan. I can use your help around here! ",	"s_d3d98e75":"That was a complete disaster!",	"s_d566a3c":"And how are the Imperials involved?",	"s_d6f2e64d":"What am I, a mind reader? They're probably concerned about Alliance attacks.",	"s_d70dba34":"Yes.",	"s_d74e67f":"According to these orders, Admiral Burke is in Doaba Guerfel on Corellia. I recommend that you keep your eyes and ears open and you just might learn something. ",	"s_d79718db":"And pirates are criminals.",	"s_d8209030":"Then you're going to Dantooine! Goodbye! ",	"s_d9116b4d":"I'll escort those freighters. ",	"s_d98a6441":"Apparently, the Black Suns are preparing to launch an assault on one of our mining interests in the Dathomir system.",	"s_d9cced1f":"Absolutely.",	"s_da8e9da5":"See? You could save the day after all! Not bad.",	"s_dbcde2d3":"And it's paid off. And now we have the chance to REALLY do some damage. And that's where you come in.",	"s_dc241019":"What'd you say?",	"s_dcabe09b":"Oh, I'm not here for a mission! I was just looking for the cantina.",	"s_de1e215f":"Traitor!",	"s_def742":"You were right.",	"s_dfc39325":"So are you, according to the Empire.",	"s_e0dc5fad":"I don't?",	"s_e30b9697":"Hey, things don't always turn out right!",	"s_e3653d50":"Here's your duty pay! You've earned it.",	"s_e380bbf8":"So you are! I hope you don't mind helping pirates.",	"s_e3e480fe":"Don't smart off to me!",	"s_e42b260e":"I'm on my way.",	"s_e86f1062":"How do you know?",	"s_e8f374d9":"Hey Rebel! I've got a new assignment for you. ",	"s_e93fce3e":"You're probably right, %NU. We've received word that they're planning to build a space station in the Lok system. They'll use it to monitor all the activity in the area.",	"s_eb1c3d4e":"Are you crazy? No one can kill an Inquisitor!",	"s_eb703128":"In that case, I'm listening.",	"s_ee83a0c2":"'Til you improve your standing with the Rebel Alliance, I wouldn't trust you to guard a faamba.",	"s_ef3e641a":"I'm here to help.",	"s_f0743f82":"I don't have any missions, but there are plenty of elective duty assignments you can perform. Is that something you think you could handle? Want me to explain it to you?",	"s_f13513cd":"Hmph! Well here's some good news. One of our men has raided an Imperial outpost on Dathomir and he walked away with plenty of loot. Now all he has to do is escape! Easier said than done, of course, as the Empire wants their things back. So you could escort our man out of Dathomir...",	"s_f15aeb5":"With pilots like you, who needs Imperials? ",	"s_f27f6d98":"Who's talking about Imperials?",	"s_f35bbdbd":"Mining interests? You make it sound almost legitimate.",	"s_f3603d67":"Don't talk back to me, junior! And don't be ridiculous! The Inquisitors are mortal, like the rest of us. Believe me, they CAN be killed. I know that for a fact. Now I want you to get out there, immediately!",	"s_f48fdfbd":"Ship's in the shop.",	"s_f50be00f":"I like the sound of that!",	"s_f51574ed":"Haha! Good point. Well then I'm a criminal. And you're going to help me. And then I'll help you - maybe. Do we understand each other?",	"s_f5427310":"Of course not!",	"s_f59d9106":"Well, %TU, think about it. The Empire needs to know what the Alliance is planning. And no one is better at gathering information than an Inquisitor.",	"s_f5cc7cf3":"Can't the vessels defend themselves?",	"s_f5d1e7f4":"Don't sass me, junior! You should be ashamed of yourself! Now go back out there and clean up that mess!",	"s_f5e4dcb6":"Stop talking and start listening! Oh great, you've made me lose my train of thought. I'll start again. The Black Suns are preparing to launch an assault on one of our mining interests. ",	"s_f60b81f8":"That's fine.",	"s_f87c573":"I give credit where credit is due! I've never seen somebody go after an Imperial base the way you did.",	"s_f95cd5f5":"Mission accomplished! And you know what that means.",	"s_fa6bfaff":"Oh. I didn't mean to upset you! I just want to rescue those mining vessels. Sorry! Go on and try again! I'm sure you'll have no problem this time.",	"s_fb4c1f1f":"I'm an Imperial.",	"s_fc27931b":"Thanks.",	"s_fc6dfba9":"Are you one of those goody two-shoes Rebels? You know, the kind that believes in the cause and all that?",	"s_fcddb599":"It does. Very wise of you to recognize that.",	"s_fed79efe":"Then hurry up and get yourself over to Dathomir!",	"s_ff9bf289":"Always, sir.",	"s_ff9fae78":"What kind of question is that?",	"s_ffeba47a":"They're not!"
