What do I need to do?",	"s_115":"Black Epsilon?",	"s_118":"I'm not interested in that.",	"s_121":"Tell me more",	"s_124":"Storm Squadron?",	"s_126":"Storm Squadron is one of the Empire's finest military units, in space or otherwise.  They're the very model of the sort of hard-core, dedicated, soldiers that secure the Empire throughout the galaxy.",	"s_128":"I'm not interested in that.",	"s_13":"I changed my mind. I will stay.",	"s_131":"Tell me more",	"s_134":"Imperial Inquisition?",	"s_137":"I'm not interested in that.",	"s_139":"Are you interested in either Black Epsilon or the Storm Squadron, sir?",	"s_13a23fbc":"Tell me what you can",	"s_141":"Tell me what you can",	"s_14270b3":"Are you here to sign-up?",	"s_15":"You've made the right choice, pilot.

I will add the location of the unit's pilot trainer to your datapad.  You may speak to him in the main plaza association hall in Kaadara, on Naboo.",	"s_3bbddad5":"Sir, I don't intend any disrespect, but the Imperial Pilots are the finest in the Galaxy.  You don't look like the sort of person who could last one week in the cadet academy, let alone pilot any sort of Imperial craft.  Now I think you should leave.  I am very busy.",	"s_3c9c6441":"Imperial Inquisition is a special unit located in the Naboo system.  Their mission is highly classified.",	"s_3d734747":"I won't release any specific details about their current engagements, but I will add the location of their recruiting officer to your datapad.

I can't release any specific details about their current engagements, but I will add the location of the Storm Squadron commander to your datapad.  He'll be glad to have a soldier of your standing.

They're the very model of the sort of hard-core, dedicated, soldiers that secure the Empire throughout the galaxy.",	"s_772c81dd":"Yes, sir.  Black Epsilon is stationed at the Imperial Base on Talus, as Corellia itself is officially neutral... for now.  There are reports of considerable Rebel activity in the area, as you can imagine.  They could really use more pilots there, sir.",	"s_79":"I'm not interested in that.",	"s_82":"Tell me more",	"s_83a7ae89":"Very well, ma'am.  Please come see me if you change your mind.

Are you here to sign-up?",	"s_8d91ee22":"Was there something else, sir?",	"s_8ed93c34":"No, just checking.",	"s_91":"Tell me what you can",	"s_929272e8":"Imperial Inquisition is a special unit located in the Naboo system, sir.  They tend to deal in highly classified missions, so I'm afraid there's not a lot I'm authorized to tell you.",	"s_94":"Never mind.",	"s_96":"Of course.  My mistake.",	"s_99e09eaf":"Ma'am, you wouldn't last one nano-second as an Imperial pilot.  It's a strenuous, demanding profession that requires the utmost dedication.  Not to mention the fact that females are notoriously bad pilots!  Now if you will excuse me, good day!",	"s_9f862c74":"What about Storm Squadron or the Imperial Inquisition?",	"s_a7d90105":"Very well, sir.

I can't release any specific details about their current engagements, but I will add the location of their own recruiter to your datapad.  If you'll speak with this officer in the Imperial Base on Talus, he will get you squared away.",	"s_be46803":"I don't think I can help you, citizen. You don't look like much of a pilot.",	"s_c2c89e35":"Yes, ma'am.  Black Epsilon is stationed at the Imperial Base on Talus, as Corellia itself is officially neutral... for now.
