		"s_ffee58bf":"Colonel Hend liked to relax with all sorts of junior officers. I don't know if I would really call them friends but they would do things together, like take leave at the same time. It was my understanding that Colonel Hend would fly them around in that yacht of his when they did. Of course, I never went with them.",		"s_ffead1ac":"Oh, and what sort of questions were those?",		"s_ff55610e":"I don't want to answer them again! Don't you even know what I told the other Inquisitors when they last questioned me? Why are you even here?",		"s_fcbf7850":"Several of the engineers do. Doctor Verr, Doctor Plenki, Doctor Shinss, and Doctor Stile all do. Even though Colonel Hend was in charge of security, there are a number of things going on here that it was not necessary for him to know about.",		"s_fb1ee7a5":"Are you aware of anyone that suspected?",		"s_fa3924b4":"I said silence! Did Colonel Hend fraternize with the Engineers corps?",		"s_f9e3a71b":"There will be no need if you answer some questions for me.",		"s_f978aafb":"Argh! If I would have seen him doing that I would have arrested him and turned him over to the Inquisition. What kind of dumb question is that?",		"s_f813490a":"You again? I don't know anything else. I have already told you everything that I know. Now please, let me continue my duties in peace.",		"s_f6fe3ce5":"Several of them do. Doctor Verr, Doctor Plenki, Doctor Shinss, and Doctor Stile all do. Even though Colonel Hend was in charge of security, there are a number of things going on here that it was not necessary for him to know about.",		"s_f211ed92":"Colonel Hend. A very bad man, but what sort of man was he?",		"s_f039fce5":"But he was a traitor, so there had to be something.",		"s_eed04a50":"Well, that isn't very professional of you. You shouldn't threaten to torture someone unless you are actually planning on doing it. It just really shows a lack of resolve and planning on your part.",		"s_ecda4c4f":"How would I know? I never asked and they never volunteered any details. All I know is that they would leave for a few days and then come back. To my understanding they filed all the appropriate transportation paperwork so it was never an issue with me.",		"s_eb02c97f":"So now I should take it easy on you?",		"s_eb02637b":"Well, I have not yet had a chance to meet with Doctor Shinss. But that doesn't mean I do not know what my duties are on this project. I understand completely what it is that needs to get done. Doctor Shinss has no reason to worry about the security of this project with me in command.",		"s_ea5a649e":"Hmmm. I really thought I was on to something there.",		"s_ea32ea5a":"Thank you for your time. I see no need to continue this conversation.",		"s_e6f64e19":"Do any of these engineers have higher security clearance than Colonel Hend?",		"s_e6ae8de":"Shinss is a good enough man. From my understanding he is supposed to be brilliant but I don't know him well enough to make a judgment to that matter.",		"s_e616a383":"Which officers were these?",		"s_e40d4ee9":"Colonel Hend was my superior officer for the past three months. I did not know him very well on a personal level, since I disapprove of officers becoming too friendly with each other.",		"s_e0659186":"Like I said, I do my job so well there is no need. Doctor Shinss doesn't have to worry about a thing now that I am charge.",		"s_dd34119b":"I don't know. He just never dealt with any of them. From what I understand he wasn't like that before I arrived. I have heard he used to be really friendly with the men but about three or four months before I arrived he just suddenly stopped dealing with any of them.",		"s_dc89a970":"Who here has higher security clearance than Colonel Hend did?",		"s_d9a69ecd":"I have no idea what is going on here but I can assure you that I have nothing to hide. I am just trying to assist you in your investigation any way that I can. But you certainly are not making this easy on me.",		"s_d8cce866":"Vrke eh? I have already spoken with you people. I had nothing to do with Colonel Hend and I didn't know anything about what he was doing.",		"s_d5ad0fe2":"Ah ha! You cannot hide your guilt behind silence!",		"s_d324b656":"So you murdered Colonel Hend out of revenge for his rejection towards you?",		"s_d2a410b8":"I am afraid that I am not following were you are going with this. I would very much like to assist the Inquisition but I don't understand what you want me to tell you.",		"s_d1dc8a70":"Aren't you head of security on this project now?",		"s_d1d8d28a":"No, of course not. But if I were Doctor Shinss, that is what I would be talking to Colonel Hend about. Hend wasn't the best of leaders. Of course, now that I am in charge the operation is running smoothly and Doctor Shinss can concentrate on his mission.",		"s_d1511c14":"So, Colonel Hend hated the enlisted men.",		"s_cfd0827b":"You really like quoting Imperial directives, don't you?",		"s_cd5b3d17":"So you are telling me you have no idea what your superior officer liked to do?",		"s_cd0207ad":"Who is this Doctor Shinss?",		"s_cb6d22cd":"I will determine if you are hiding anything or not!",		"s_cb65c4f9":"I suppose that could have been the case. I really do not like to speculate about things like that. Is there anything else you wanted to know?",		"s_ca59425a":"I don't care how busy you are. We are going to talk.",		"s_c97a22d4":"You are not supposed to understand the mysteries of the Inquisition!",		"s_c4c46aa":"You are completely mad. From what I heard, you were the one who killed Colonel Hend. In the Dantooine system. Thousands of light years from here. Where I was. It would have been impossible for me to have murdered Colonel Hend!",		"s_c3c8f385":"[silence]",		"s_c39786e7":"How would arresting a superior officer violate the directive banning the use of an Imperial officer's hat as a Wookiee beating device? I am afraid that I really don't understand your question.",		"s_c37cc43f":"Who else did Colonel Hend go on trips with?",		"s_c346ae59":"You really do not have a clue do you? I am finished here. Good day.",		"s_c3185891":"How often would the two of them meet?",		"s_c2631c46":"Tell me some more about the people Colonel Hend dealt with.",		"s_bf9b99b9":"I am not hiding anything. You told me to be silent so I was silent. I may have to follow your orders and answer you questions but I will not tolerate any accusations against my loyalty. But to answer your question, Colonel Hend didn't fraternize with anyone from the engineering corps. He obviously worked with them since he was head of security.",		"s_becaf709":"Just as I suspected. You are innocent.",		"s_be74eb0":"If I had that information, I would have given it to the Inquisitors that were here before. All I know is that Hend liked to spend his off time with some of the junior officers. They all get together after they were off duty and sometimes they would all take leave together and go out on Hend's yacht. But I don't think any of them even knew.",		"s_b969a839":"That's not important right now. What is important are these engineers.",		"s_b83437a1":"You were the one telling me to ask you about it.",		"s_b72bfe9c":"You say that Colonel Hend had lots of friends. Tell me about them.",		"s_b693b85f":"Fine. What questions would you like me to answer?",		"s_b39c7b81":"Sorry, that sounded much more intimidating in my head.",		"s_aeb1b3ee":"Perhaps you are unaware of what you actually know.",		"s_ac8cb7ce":"Yeah, maybe in a mirror or something. Anyway...what was I saying?",		"s_aa484e27":"What? Oh...you mean other than a bad man. He was a fair commander. Liked his junior officer a bit too much in my opinion. But nothing about him ever gave away the fact that he was a traitor.",		"s_a82360e0":"Fine, fine. Ask me anything. What would you like to know?",		"s_a72db7d9":"Yes? What do you want? I am extremely busy.",		"s_a623d5ba":"Did you ever suspect Colonel Hend as a traitor?",		"s_a55b2dc8":"There is little need for me to meet with the Doctor. I do my duty and he has his operation to run. I run a very tight ship so that Doctor Shinss doesn't have to constantly hold my hand like he always did with Colonel Hend. It seemed like every time I turned around, Shinss and Hend had their heads together discussing what a terrible job Colonel Hend was doing.",		"s_a43281d6":"What engineers? The ones that are running the salvage operation in this system? They are the whole reason that any of us are here. The engineers are locating and extracting the most important pieces from the debris in order to be reused in other projects.",		"s_a3391195":"I most certainly am not going to pour us both a drink. I am on duty and so are you. Imperial directive 43C-90L clearly states that the consumption of spirits while on duty is punishable by two weeks in the brig.",		"s_a253bfbf":"You are insane.",		"s_9d22bb03":"He never went on leave with Doctor Shinss, but they did work together in an official capacity. They would take shuttles out to inspect the debris fields.",		"s_9d1204e3":"Sorry, I am sort of new at this whole Inquisition thing.",		"s_9ce47b1f":"Let it out? Let what out? Why aren't you asking questions like the other Inquisitor's were doing?",		"s_9cb92ec3":"So these engineers would know how the Death Star worked?",		"s_9bdca9f6":"Do you know what goes on here?",		"s_9b59f040":"So you were jealous?",		"s_99701b9c":"So he had a light complexion. Very interesting.",		"s_91237089":"What do you mean, trying to protect Doctor Shinss? I am not protecting anyone. He and Colonel Hend worked together. As head of the project and head of security they spent a lot of time in meetings planning for the project.",		"s_90c2580f":"Why are you trying to protect Doctor Shinss?",		"s_900f01d1":"What?",		"s_8fa4c7bd":"Well, who did he fraternize with if not the engineers?",		"s_8d77e799":"Never mind. Do you know of anyone who might have known Hend was a traitor?",		"s_8931a146":"What would he do with the engineers?",		"s_883e63f3":"Who were these friends of Colonel Hend?",		"s_874f9344":"You are protesting a lot. Are you sure you are not guilty of something?",		"s_85e6fdd1":"What else do you want to know about them?",		"s_85c0a145":"Where would they go on these trips?",		"s_81caddeb":"So you don't believe that officers should work together?",		"s_80254eb2":"I suppose you are right. So would you answer some questions for me?",		"s_802362c2":"Shinss and Hend spent a lot of time together?",		"s_7ef5613c":"I said silence! Now, how well did you know Colonel Hend?",		"s_7ed6dd6":"Who amongst those engineers had the most contact with Hend?",		"s_7ebbd888":"Not in the least. I tell you that I am a fine officer and you can quote me on that if you wish. I hope that I have been helpful to your investigation. Good day.",		"s_7e952afa":"Of course. It is the duty of every Imperial officer to assist any Inquisition agent on assignment. I will be very glad to answer any questions that you might have.",		"s_7b1ee2bd":"It's okay. Just let it out.",		"s_797cf757":"Don't you deal with the Doctor now?",		"s_760db2a":"While they were on duty it was constant. Shinss was always in Colonel Hend's office complaining about the way he was running things. Several times they had to take shuttles out to view the debris fields. I think Shinss wanted to actually show Colonel Hend what he needed. That sort of thing.",		"s_749aece":"So I take it you are working closely with Doctor Shinss now as well.",		"s_7324835":"That is most interesting. And by enemy you mean the Rebellion?",		"s_72ceec2c":"Do not question my methods! Tell me about Colonel Hends friends.",		"s_7061349d":"Of course they did. They were in quite a few private meetings together, almost daily. They would take shuttles out to inspect the debris field together quite often. Nothing out of the ordinary.",		"s_6f94037e":"Who here had higher security clearance than Colonel Hend?",		"s_6c17ce1b":"I thought we had already determined that I had nothing to do with Colonel Hend being a traitor. I know that has to look bad for a second not to be aware of his commanders activities but that is the truth. I have nothing to hide from the Inquisition.",		"s_6bd0e9b":"I am not hiding anything. You told me to be silent so I was silent. I may have to follow your orders and answer you questions but I will not tolerate any accusations against my loyalty. To answer your question, I really don't know what Colonel Hend did in his spare time.",		"s_6ac3f291":"Not really. He dealt with Doctor Shinss mostly but that was all official work. Doctor Shinss is the head of the salvage operation and it was important for the head of security to work closely with him.",		"s_6a726863":"Of course they would know. Many of them helped build the station. That is another reason why security is so tight on this operation. We cannot allow any of these scientists to fall into enemy hands. The knowledge they possess is of great importance to the Empire.",		"s_6773e97b":"That would definitely be Doctor Shinss. He is head of the project so naturally spent the most time with Colonel Hend.",		"s_65ec117a":"Good! Now I can get back to work.",		"s_64113df0":"I recommend that you try saying those things out loud in private before you actually say them to someone else. That way you won't come off like some sort of crazed fool.",		"s_62adf222":"Let me get this straight, you never meet with Doctor Shinss?",		"s_62784e3f":"He was head of security on an operation that was being run by the engineers. He dealt with them everyday but I wouldn't say that he ever did anything with any of them. ",		"s_61c6827c":"Wouldn't arresting a superior officer violate Imperial directive T44A-0-niner?",		"s_61286e9e":"Uh? Am I in some sort of trouble? You are not going to do anything to me are you? Because I will have you know that torture of an officer is forbidden under Imperial directive Y70-32C subsection 14.",		"s_5ffde8db":"So Colonel Hend spent time alone with the other engineers?",		"s_5c896992":"That is because you are not paying attention.",		"s_5bc4c2f1":"Of course you don't. That is why I am here and you are there.",		"s_5b81ae31":"I would imagine so. But I was unable to determine what those signs were. As far as I knew, Colonel Hend was absolutely loyal to the Empire. If I would have had any inkling otherwise, I would have reported him.",		"s_59904aa4":"My mission is a mystery that will reveal itself in time.",		"s_58079535":"Maybe you would be more comfortable if you pour us both a drink.",		"s_57cfb6a7":"You said your last statement like you don't know what is going on.",		"s_55a16d2b":"Did you ever see Colonel Hend steal secrets and give them to the Rebellion?",		"s_540a88a5":"As a matter of fact. Yes! What engineers?",		"s_51df4407":"Classic sign of betrayal. Those most hurt by his treason would be the men in the trenches.",		"s_4ccd5b75":"I certainly hope not. I will still be required to speak with Inquisitor Vrke about your behavior. It was completely unacceptable.",		"s_4c90f2a4":"Is that a threat? I suggest you just answer my questions.",		"s_4c694267":"There is something seriously wrong with you. Why would I be jealous of Colonel Hend's relationship with other officers? I just disapproved, that is all. I mean I never really wanted to have anything to do with him...other than being under his command.",		"s_4bbd7016":"What? I didn't say that. I said that I didn't think that officers should become friends. It ruins the objectiveness of command. I was less than pleased by Colonel Hend's relationship with some of the other officers on the project.",		"s_47e55614":"So which is it? 'No one' or 'Doctor Shinss'?.",		"s_46897102":"Really? Who would you have reported him to?",		"s_45ebf891":"So you were there while they had their discussions?",		"s_45d046d5":"Very well. But I will have you know that I will be in contact with Inquisitor Vrke as soon as this interview is done and discuss your behavior towards a superior officer. You might be a member of the Inquisition, but I am a Lieutenant Colonel in the Imperial Army and your respect is still expected.",		"s_45363db1":"There was the group of junior officers, mostly members of the security force, although there were some Naval men in that group as well. Of course, he had dealing with the engineers handling the salvage operation. I never saw him with any of the enlisted men or civilians. In fact I don't think I ever even heard of him talking to any of them. When he had to deal with any of the men, he would always delegate that to another officer.",		"s_4355764f":"I do not recall requesting your presence? If you have no business here I highly suggest that you get back to your unit or where ever you came from.",		"s_40f102e4":"My name is not important. I am here on behalf of Inquisitor Vrke.",		"s_3d1204e0":"Of course I will cooperate. It is every Imperial officer's duty to cooperate in the fullest with any Inquisition investigation. All you had to do was ask. You didn't have to threaten me like that.",		"s_3cdbed0b":"This is getting nowhere. I am going to have to end this interview right now unless you get to the point. Inquisition or no, I am very busy man and do not have time to waste answering fool questions.",		"s_3c8f00ed":"How often would Hend and Shinss meet?",		"s_3c673988":"Uh...yes of course. Who did you think I meant?",		"s_3be36a24":"What do you mean I don't have a clue? You were the one asking all of those crazy questions. Bah, fine! I have work to do anyway.",		"s_3b0eba1c":"I would at least appreciate a little respect. You may work for the Inquisition which means that I have to obey you while you are on assignment but you are making an enemy here.",		"s_39774984":"Of course not. If I had I would have arrested him and made my report according to Imperial directive J323-9V. I wish I had known, so I could have put an end to it. It makes me sick to know that I served under a traitor.",		"s_394ac527":"Doctor Shinss is head of the salvage operation. He and his team of engineers are locating and extracting the most important pieces from the debris in order to be reused in other projects. He worked closely with Colonel Hend to ensure the safety of all involved.",		"s_38ae0970":"You were going to ask me about Colonel Hend.",		"s_379b50a7":"No! As I said before, I don't think that officers should get too friendly with each other. Also since I was second in command I had to stay here when Colonel Hend went on leave. It might have been nice to receive an invitation but I completely understand.",		"s_3700f6":"Silence! I will ask you questions and you will answer them.",		"s_3668d398":"I am sorry that they left you out of their fun. That must be very painful for you.",		"s_35f73adf":"Did Colonel Hend spend any time with any of them?",		"s_3181543b":"He spent most of his off hours with a few of the junior officers. Occasionally the group of them would take leave together and fly off in Hend's yacht. Nothing really out of the ordinary, although I must say I don't approve of officers mixing in social circumstances.",		"s_30a96327":"Really? How many times have you had private meetings with Doctor Shinss?",		"s_2e851dd5":"Silence fool! I am tired of listening to you. Good day.",		"s_2b71207d":"Uh...whatever you wish, Inquisitor. I hope that you have gotten the answers you were looking for, although I don't see how. Good day.",		"s_2b0fcb12":"Yes, I know that. I was just testing to see if you were paying attention.",		"s_2a60fbf6":"Not that I ever saw. But Doctor Shinss was project lead. It was necessary for him to deal with Colonel Hend in order to organize security.",		"s_28a49383":"And now you are going to talk with me.",		"s_283dca97":"I believe you colonel. Now about Colonel Hend's friends?",		"s_2723a841":"On to what? You accused me of being a traitor, then you accuse me of murdering someone half-way across the galaxy! I try to tell you what I know and you accuse me of having an inappropriate fascination with Colonel Hend! I have no idea what this line of questioning is all about. ",		"s_24614dc6":"A member of the Inquisition is never foolish! You will pay for that statement!",		"s_22cf270c":"I am not hiding anything. You told me to be silent so I was silent. I may have to follow your orders and answer you questions but I will not tolerate any accusations against my loyalty. To answer your question, Colonel Hend was my superior officer for the past three months. I did not know him very well on a personal level, since I disapprove of officers becoming too friendly with each other.",		"s_2188ff96":"First I would have arrested him and then made my report according to Imperial directive J323-9V. I wish I had known, so I could have put an end to it. It makes me sick to know that I served under a traitor.",		"s_20ff0a31":"You know. Things like where were you on date so and so. Did you ever see Colonel Hend do this. Are you loyal to the Empire. Things like that!",		"s_2002f393":"If the other Inquisitors already asked those why do you want to answer them again?",		"s_1fa017ef":"I said silence! What did Colonel Hend do in his spare time?",		"s_1dfabdd9":"No one. Well, actually he would travel around with Doctor Shinss inspecting the debris fields, but that was official business and not Leave.",		"s_1b131a47":"I am sure that he doesn't worry about you. I must be going.",		"s_1ae1c792":"Hmmm...",		"s_1a949924":"Yes, I was promoted after Colonel Hend's death.",		"s_18782a4b":"Of these engineers who had the most contact with Hend?",		"s_15fccf52":"Who did Colonel Hend spend most of his time with?",		"s_1506d494":"What! What does that mean? I don't understand what you are talking about.",		"s_14c38c33":"What sort of man is Doctor Shinss?",		"s_129cd101":"You do have my full attention, Inquisitor. What can I help you with?",		"s_127f71ad":"This is a restricted area. I suggest that you move along before I am forced to charge you under violation of Imperial directive T43-X9A.",		"s_12173b9e":"Of course I don't know what is going on around here. My security clearance is the same as Colonel Hend's was. So how could I know?",		"s_110ac144":"Thank you for your time, Colonel. There will be no need for us to speak again.",		"s_107a83ec":"Did the two of them ever spend any time alone together?",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (naboo_imperial_tier3_barlow.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
