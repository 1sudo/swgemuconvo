What do you want?",	"s_14":"Faeto isn't looking for you. He's after Untas.",	"s_16":"Thank the Force! I was sure Faeto was after me. What do you want?",	"s_17":"I don't know you and I don't trust you. I only trust my lovely Taibela.",	"s_19":"Taibela sent me.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Prove it. Do you have a token from her for me?",	"s_21":"Yes right in my pack. ",	"s_22":"Well open your back pack and give me what she gave you. ",	"s_23":"I told you where to find his pal. Now go.",	"s_24":"Where is Untas?",	"s_26":"Last I heard Sleash and he ran off somewhere. I know that Sleash had some deal in the works with Vaigon Shinn, but I have no clue about Untas. You'll need to convince Sleash to loosen his tongue if you want him to tell you anything.",	"s_28":"And how would I do that?",	"s_30":"This dar' kel spice should do the trick. Go gift it to Sleash before you ask about Untas, and he should tell you anything you want. He has a weakness for this particular spice.",	"s_46":"Huh? I don't have anything to say to you. And tell Faeto to leave me and mine alone.",	"s_48":"I think I'll pass on this one.",	"s_50":"You won't get to him without the dar' kel.",	"s_9":"Go away. I heard what you do. Go!"
