And here's my beacon. It's a bit damaged and not working correctly, but Vance should be able to fix it. You should return to him with it.",	"s_12":"Vance Groten sent me.",	"s_14":"How is ole Vance? Haven't seen him in ages. Why would he send you to me?",	"s_15":"These are really nice trophies. I especially like Sprywing's talons. My friends are going to be jealous that I have them.",	"s_16":"I shall do that. Hopefully Vance can fix it.",	"s_17":"I'm sure he can. Good luck.",	"s_18":"I'm looking for a security beacon from Stonewall Labs.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Keep going until you have all of the hunting trophies. I'll give you my security beacon in exchange for them.",	"s_21":"Oh, really? As it happens, I do have one of those. I'd gladly give it to an RSF trooper like yourself, but I think you can do something for me in exchange.",	"s_23":"What do you want me to do?",	"s_25":"Hunting has always been a hobby of mine, but age and poor health pretty much ensure that I can't do it any more. So here's the deal, I'll trade my security beacon for some hunting trophies. ",	"s_27":"What kind of hunting trophies?",	"s_29":"Well, let's see. I'd like some mountain spineflap wings. Also there's a mountain spineflap known as Sprywing. I'd like her talons. Oh, and some narglatch fangs.",	"s_31":"Okay, I'll be back with those trophies.",	"s_33":"Thank you. Start with the mountain spineflaps.",	"s_43":"Then there was the time I stalked a giant peko-peko for ten days. It got away, but for me it was all about the hunt, not the kill. Okay, okay. I really wish it hadn't gotten away. It would make for a better story.",	"s_56":"Hello, was there something I could do for you?"
