		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (ep3_forest_npc_greeter.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor.",	"s_10":"Alright, Shaey Kayr. Tell me about this place.",	"s_103":"Ahh... the Kerritamba village. The Kerritamba village is led by Chief Kerritamba who comes from a long, strong line of Wookiee warriors. The Kerritamba people go about their lives, distrusting most and turning away the rest. The only way to get them to warm up is through their leader. Speak with him if you wish to earn their trust.",	"s_104":"I see. Thank you for the information.",	"s_105":"Indeed. What other area do you want to learn about?",	"s_106":"The Dead Forest is a dangerous place. I don't recommend going there. [Shaey shrugs.] The Sayormi live there and revel in the dead forest around them. They practice their voodoo, cursing anything that lives in this place. Additionally, you'll find the Mouf gentle creatures that are better left alone. The Sayormi own them. No one dares enter the Dead Forest anymore.",	"s_107":"Hmm.",	"s_108":"What other area do you want to learn about?",	"s_109":"As expected, webweaver spiders live there, guarded by their Outcast friends. The Outcasts are people who have been shunned from the Kerritamba way of life. They retreated into the caves and live there. Even today, the Kerritamba people and the Outcasts are at war. It would be best to leave their rivalry be.",	"s_110":"Is anything pleasant here?",	"s_111":"Not likely. What other area do you want to learn about?",	"s_112":"The Great Tree, also known to the Kerritamba people as Nyenthi'Oris, lives on the island to the north, past the Kerritamba village and on the Chenataa river. The Great Tree is diseased and dying. The Chief of the Kerritamba village is trying to find a cure even to this day. It is a sad tale.",	"s_168":"I wonder if I can help somehow.",	"s_169":"You'll have to speak with him about that. What other area do you want to learn about?",	"s_170":"The Myyydril Caverns is a mystery to those not living within its cold, damp walls. You'll have to travel there yourself. However, it is a dangerous place. Far more dangerous than even the Kkowir Forest.",	"s_171":"How do I get there?",	"s_172":"You must go north, past the Kerritamba village, to the Chenataa river. Follow it west until you see a small path covered with foliage and trees. Follow the path and you'll soon find the Myyydril Caverns. I suggest bringing friends before venturing inward.",	"s_173":"I see.",	"s_174":"What other area do you want to learn about?",	"s_175":"Well, you have several options. You can visit the Kerritamba village and speak with Chief Kerritamba or you can find the Myyydril Caverns. Do you need any information about these areas?",	"s_176":"Thank you for the information. I'm going to explore.",	"s_177":"I hope you'll be safe. [Shaey bows and waves.]",	"s_2":"",	"s_4":"[Shaey nods to you.] Looks like you're a little lost...",	"s_6":"Yeah. I'm new to this area.",	"s_78":"There's certain areas of the Kkowir Forest that make up its cold charm. Which area do you want to know about? There's the Dead Forest, the Webweaver Caves, the Kerritamba Village, the Great Tree, and the Myyydril Caverns.",	"s_79":"Tell me about the Dead Forest.",	"s_8":"Ah, I see. Let me introduce myself. [Shaey bows.] I am Shaey Kayr, Kashyyyk Explorer extraordinaire! I know everything about Kashyyyk... and more! You have questions? Shaey Kayr has answers!",	"s_80":"Tell me about the Webweaver Caves.",	"s_81":"Tell me about the Kerritamba Village.",	"s_82":"Tell me about the Great Tree.",	"s_83":"Tell me about the Myyydril Caverns.",	"s_84":"I know about the areas. Where do I go next?"
