Go get that sensor array repaired!",	"s_1b7f8e6d":"Good! You'd better get to work then. The sooner we get that thing back online, the better!",	"s_27808b0b":"Good show! If you help us out with this, I will help you learn to use the Force to enhance your assembly skills.",	"s_4beb938f":"Yes, I suppose I am.",	"s_52acc0":"That's a shame. If you find someone who will... send 'em over.",	"s_5ec4a1e":"Alright, well if you see someone who is... send 'em over.",	"s_6a934b47":"Master... I must find the master.",	"s_75cdc0ad":"On second thought, I don't think that I can help you.",	"s_8459377a":"Yes, I will go repair the sensor array.",	"s_8abf86da":"You want me to take a look at the sensor array?",	"s_8d878ba7":"That's a shame. If you find someone who can... send 'em over.",	"s_9ae334e4":"I think that I can handle that.",	"s_9cdcc110":"That's it exactly. You catch on quick. If you will, take a look at the damage, see what needs to be repaired, and fix it up for us.",	"s_a4a9c8e0":"Oh, in that case I'd rather not do it.",	"s_ac061a6f":"That sounds fine to me.",	"s_b2dd509a":"Great. Our sensor array was damaged in the last attack on this village by the Sith Shadows. It needs to be repaired, but unfortunately, our chief engineer was also killed in the attack.",	"s_be3bc184":"Hey! You got that all fixed up, didn't you? And just in time. You're all right, you know that?",	"s_c9f1dbdc":"That doesn't sound like something that I can do.",	"s_e05cc4d4":"What's going on here? I'm all confused! I don't know what's going on!",	"s_e26f0607":"Of course you understand that this job will take a while, and if you agree to fix this thing, you won't be able to help anyone else with anything for a while, right?",	"s_ebabb0f8":"You there! Are you handy with a set of tools?",	"s_f1a421d":"Say, I know you. They tell me you've been a great help. Good job.",	"s_f474ed78":"Not really no.",	"s_fae10418":"What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here!",	"s_faf1fbe4":"You there! Are you handy with a set of tools? Eh... looks like you're too busy to help me anyway. Nevermind."
