I feared that the light had fallen from my administration, plunging the entire government into a darkness from which there would be no escape. But then out of that growing darkness, our hero arose. You!",	"s_14":"Please do not waste time chatting with me when you are supposed to be invading my privacy.  I mean, conducting your legal search. I have no desire to prolong this, so please concentrate on your duty.",	"s_16":"Yes, hello. I'm quite busy, but if you can make it quick, I'll listen to what you have to say.",	"s_18":"Here are the writs to search your office.",	"s_19":"Do you recognize this device on your terminal??",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"What? That device? I've never seen it before in my life, but at any rate, I'm not a technician. Take the device if you wish.",	"s_22":"What's this? I see. Well, everything seems to be in order. I suppose there's nothing I can do about this at this point. Don't worry, I know that you're just doing your job. As must we all.",	"s_23":"I'm glad to have cleared you, sir.",	"s_24":"You have done us a great service this day, and it is my honor to recognize that service with the Corellian Medal of Distinguished Service! Lt. Jasper has your medal. Go speak with him to receive it.",	"s_26":"Well met, citizen. I'm afraid I do not have time to chat, but I can wish you a good day and a nice visit in the capitol.",	"s_4":"My friend! You are always welcome. Nothing will sway me away from taking the time to thank you, for nothing I do would be possible without you. Thank you once again.",	"s_9":"I could have told you that you'd find nothing, because there is nothing to find."
