You look like maybe you could, if you wanted. I just want to get back what's mine. What I mean is that I designed a power cell that was more efficient and potentially cheaper to manufacture. But Kazic Pendre took my design notes and the schematic and left me with nothing. Would you get my design schematic for me? Please?",	"s_44":"I'll be glad to help.",	"s_45":"No, I don't think so.",	"s_46":"Thank you. You'll most likely find it on a research terminal of some sort.",	"s_47":"Ah, well, it's just as well. I should be doing my own work rather than fostering it off on someone else.",	"s_48":"Yes, this is it. Thank! Thank you very much. I can use this design as the beginnings of my own business. Thank you!",	"s_49":"You'll most likely find the design notes and schematic for my power cell on a research terminal of some sort."
