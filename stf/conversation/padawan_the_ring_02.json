That's funny.  You mean this ring? The one I took from Keicho? The one he balked on when it came time to place a bet. I won his landspeeder last week, and his wifes wedding gown the week before that.  I love that gown. But he wouldn't bet the ring. Couldn't understand why, so I just took it.",	"s_6a1562ad":"What do you want?",	"s_711691ff":"I'm looking for a wedding ring, have you seen one?",	"s_759ab6bb":"Unless what?",	"s_77a2c8a3":"We will see about that.",	"s_80764fc6":"Yeah, and I don't plan on giving it up.

Either you fight me for this here ring, or you go back to him empty handed.",	"s_cd72f93":"Good choice.",	"s_cdc241bf":"Well then it doesn't look like you are going to be returning to your good friend with this here ring.  Unless...",	"s_ce804243":"What? Looking for a fight? Not today, chump, but definitely some other time.",	"s_cec4328":"Forty million credits and a penthouse apartment in Coruscant?",	"s_d38d76e0":"This does not have to get violent.",	"s_e4815789":"You took it?",	"s_f42e101f":"I've got races to win and chumps to scam.  Answer the question or get out of my face.  What do you want?"
