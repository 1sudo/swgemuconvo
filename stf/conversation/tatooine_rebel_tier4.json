I'm looking for a pilot willing to intercept prison ships in the Dathomir system. Those ships are carrying Rebels, and we need those men here with us!

Are you ready for a duty assignment? Or would you like to hear the briefing again?",	"s_3a640dfa":"And now they know we're out here, so they're sure to come after us eventually.

Which mission will you take?",	"s_62fa1f75":"There's an Imperial space station in Endor. I think that's where the engineers are unloading the new models. So that's your primary target.

This place is lousy with Imperials! What did you learn?",	"s_c5512cb2":"I'm giving you access to a space assault droid. It'll help you to get the job done. The droid will take control of the ship, once you've disabled the pilot. ",	"s_c82e9a2f":"Yes, please.",	"s_c84fe27f":"You got that right. Tell me, what did you accomplish while you were with Ulvaw'op?",	"s_c8a0830d":"Especially those guns.",	"s_c946f118":"So here's what we're going to do. %TU, you're going to hijack one of those ships.",	"s_cb594529":"Well soldier, you've earned the right to upgrade to a new skill. I expect all my pilots to continue their training, at all times!",	"s_cbcd1643":"We were able to capture several spies, a security officer, and an Imperial defector.",	"s_cc7b5947":"See that you do. Head for the Endor system immediately. Dismissed.",	"s_d059f8aa":"Those TIE fighters are tough!",	"s_d0fd857b":"I'll take it.",	"s_d157e1de":"I'm looking for missions.",	"s_d30b6d26":"Congratulations, soldier. You're officially a part of the Crimson Phoenix.",	"s_d3234c01":"Alliance leaders need to know that they can deploy a full Crimson Phoenix squad at any time. ",	"s_d55f2579":"I'm ready to go.",	"s_d5a98554":"I have your duty pay.",	"s_d68a9f0a":"At least you'll have the element of surprise. They're not expecting an attack. I want you to get out there and hit as many of them as you can. We've uploaded coordinates to your ships computer. You're clear to leave for the Dathomir system.",	"s_d82b46ba":"I'll try to bring it back in one piece.",	"s_d9cced1f":"Absolutely.",	"s_db77876d":"I sure as heck am not going to put an untested pilot in charge of important missions. I need to test you out. See what you're made of. Pilots in this unit have nerves of steel. Do you have nerves of steel?",	"s_e075ea09":"You'll be serving under Admiral Willham Burke. You may have heard of him. He's commander of the Fourth Battle Group stationed in the Outer Rim, two time recipient of the Alliance Medal of Valor, and one of the finest field commanders in the business.",	"s_e1da7727":"I can handle it.",	"s_e2a4b15e":"Don't talk to me until you've completed your mission.",	"s_e2aefddd":"Always. And in the meantime, we've got to find a way to deal with these new TIE fighters. It's going to take a while before we find a way to modify their technology for our X-Wings. ",	"s_e42b260e":"I'm on my way.",	"s_e7488f0b":"You'll find the Admiral on Corellia, in Doaba Guerfel. You had better prepare yourself. The Fourth Battle Group takes on some of the most dangerous and difficult tasks in the Outer Rim.",	"s_e816c4f3":"I'm not following, sir.",	"s_e81875f0":"I don't think they did this in-house. I think the Empire is working with a third party.",	"s_ea7b0fb2":"Up 'til now, we've been able to level the playing field just by gutting it out.",	"s_eb925c97":"I thought you said you WANTED to be a part of the Crimson Phoenix.",	"s_ef167e72":"Where am I headed?",	"s_f00c2726":"Personally? Not much. Ulvaw'op was in charge of interrogations, and he wasn't exactly forthcoming with me.",	"s_f252cbc8":"I can assure you that Admiral Burke will not be interested in how great you think you are. He'll expect you to shut your mouth and do your job.",	"s_f3bbd7e7":"I'm not so sure that's a good idea. I'll give you one more shot.",	"s_f3c74323":"Well now you're going to do what I tell you.",	"s_f3eda860":"I'd like to know who's building these ships. They could answer a lot of questions for us. ",	"s_f60ad3e3":"You've earned it. You've done everything I've asked, and then some.",	"s_f689a56f":"The Alliance wants to know one thing. They want to know if OUR best can handle THEIR best. And this is where they get their answer. Right here. Right now.",	"s_f69a2921":"Glad to hear it.",	"s_f73581de":"Now listen. Based on the numbers, they've got us beat. No doubt about it. They've got far more ships out there than we do. So every single one of my fighters has got to do the job of TEN pilots.",	"s_f7cbbb30":"And you're in luck. You're going to be one of the first Rebel soldiers to get an up close look at the new Imperial ships.",	"s_fa396956":"What's the project?",	"s_fb05125c":"If Ulvaw'op would just TELL us something, maybe we could anticipate these kinds of problems! ",	"s_fb3d31a9":"You earned it. Good work out there.",	"s_fb9f7cd6":"I'll deliver it to you personally.",	"s_fbb318e5":"How can I help, sir?",	"s_fed525e5":"Let's see how you do. This is your big break, %TU. Don't screw it up."
