Like I said, I've already ordered the fountain and that includes paying for it. I no longer have the money.",	"s_1fb826e9":"Because an Imperial investigator decided to look into it and now claims that it was all a fraud. And that I've kept the money for myself. But I haven't! I ordered the fountain. It should be here any day now. That's even why I rented this load-carrying droid. Just waiting now for the fountain to arrive. I hope it's not much longer.",	"s_1fd2fde4":"Sounds like a nice idea. Why are you so worried?",	"s_39b9ae7":"Sounds like a pretty bad situation.",	"s_3f9656b2":"You could not be more correct. That investigator seems to be out for blood. My friend here, Larek, thinks we should just leave the planet and hide out. Maybe join the Rebellion. But I really shouldn't be saying that. The fountain is on the way. It'll be here. It has to.",	"s_5071a40b":"Maybe you should just give all the money back?",	"s_61113bf6":"What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Where is that fountain? That stupid fountain.",	"s_9f080930":"Oh, it's a fountain I raised money for. I wanted to do something for the community here in Tyrena. There's a big empty plaza over near the Agrilat Geyser. I thought it would be nice to have a fountain there. So I asked for donations to raise money for one.",	"s_dd05928":"What fountain?"
