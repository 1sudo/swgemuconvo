I've heard of your work with CorSec. Lt. Jasper is a friend of mine from way back. You must be out here investigating the Chirq Council. Chun and I are as well, though we have different assignments. Hey, maybe you can give me a hand with my assignment?",	"s_44":"I'll be happy to help.",	"s_45":"No, I don't think I can.",	"s_46":"Great. The Chirq Council is experimenting with a new kind of mechanized guardian. My assignment is to hamper the production of those mechanized guardians. I figure the best way to do that is to destroy the ones they already have. Your part would be to enter the Chirq Council bunker and destroy any mechanized guardians you find.",	"s_47":"Right. I apologize. I shouldn't heap even more work onto you. I should know better.",	"s_48":"Good mechanized guardian destroying. I couldn't have done better myself. Seriously, not even close. Thank you.",	"s_49":"My assignment is to hamper the production of those mechanized guardians. I figure the best way to do that is to destroy the ones they already have.
