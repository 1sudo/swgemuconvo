		"s_fe1b33c5":"I see. Well, it's not too late to try again. Please go out there and complete your mission. It's important.",		"s_fdba7430":"You can count on me.",		"s_fcf8c341":"I kinda failed my mission.",		"s_f0445c1d":"What are you talking about...?",		"s_ec4258cd":"Sure, I guess.",		"s_ea18852":"The Black Nemesis?! Yes, I have briefly heard of such a 'ghost' a long time ago. Yes, indeed. Even in the information you retrieved off the Black Suns it was mentioned about a mysterious fighter in the Ghost Tide. It is time to act against this so-called Black Nemesis! Will you continue to be an asset to us and help?",		"s_e8b2ad1e":"You've returned so quickly! What have you discovered?",		"s_e7f5f946":"Over and out.",		"s_e7cb1e01":"Thank you again. I will.",		"s_e7af48c":"Indeed. Thank you again for the help you've so selflessly lent us.",		"s_e635adbf":"Good. I need you to patrol the Ghost Tide nebula in search of odd activities. I have no idea what we're looking for here. I have no idea what we're looking for here. However, I do suspect that whatever or whomever is causing the freighters to disappear will show up soon enough. I've transmitted the data you'll need to complete your mission. Please... be safe.",		"s_dfe42352":"The Black Nemesis has been defeated. Our freighters will be able to travel safely now because of you. I am very grateful for your help. Unfortunately, our work together must end. I have no more that needs to be done.",		"s_dfba44fb":"Over and out!",		"s_de1d7ae9":"I'll have to investigate this myself!",		"s_dc79df4f":"What happened out there? All I could hear was static.",		"s_cd91abc2":"I think you're too far away. I can't get your signal.",		"s_c9f21b00":"I really need to know what's going on.",		"s_c8053613":"Black Nemesis or no, I don't want to help.",		"s_c738862c":"[sigh] I see. It is not too late. Go out there and try again.",		"s_c5afcca4":"Soon, I will have more work for you. Visit me when you have the time.",		"s_c34478b1":"I've heard nothing but bad news about your performance. What went wrong?",		"s_c14d0f0c":"You seem rather busy. You should probably come back a little bit later. I may have some tasks that may suit you.",		"s_c0dec268":"Possibly. I just need someone to investigate. Will you?",		"s_bf8bb897":"Of course. Your next task entails going up against this Black Nemesis. You'll need help, however. I'm going to employ the help of my two best fighter pilots to aid you in this. It won't be easy. Will you accept this task and help us against the Black Nemesis?",		"s_b9b27823":"Thank you.",		"s_b4b3fdb5":"[You tell Kelen about the Black Nemesis]",		"s_ae1a82fc":"I'm so not going to get into this.",		"s_a99397a":"Yeah, I guess so.",		"s_a23289f6":"There has been a disturbance in the galaxy...",		"s_a18139bb":"I'm going to think about doing this later..",		"s_a118c43e":"[You relay the events to Kelen]",		"s_a020b1a9":"I like to hear such eagerness! Go then, and be quick about it. I've uploaded the information you'll need to complete your mission. I wish you luck.",		"s_9eaf76c6":"I am eager to hear what you have to say, my friend. What did you discover?",		"s_969c4dc2":"I don't know. What does it entail?",		"s_95d8887f":"How unfortunate.",		"s_9208410d":"...",		"s_8d73b3f1":"I really don't want to help right now.",		"s_8a564db7":"Indeed. He's still out there though. What are you waiting for! Go try again!",		"s_890511af":"I see you have no desire to help us. Go away. This is a serious matter!!",		"s_81b811c0":"Why thank you.",		"s_8167d29a":"Glad to hear it. Over and out.",		"s_7d7ae55":"You haven't heard of the freighter disappearances? Where have you been, man?! Let me explain. Firstly, I am Kelen Wordkal, Mos Eisley Police Captain. One of my duties is to clear freighters to their destination. It is their duty to check in with me so I know they've reached it safely. The freighters cleared to go through the Ghost Tide Nebula have never returned...",		"s_76cb0e7f":"Nah. Ghosts are scary.",		"s_724ce284":"You say you saw Black Suns in the Ghost Tide Nebula, correct? I don't think the Black Suns are all that stupid. Perhaps if there's information on them... You need to go out and disable a few and get me the information they might have. I'm not certain any information or clues exist, but I'm willing to take the chance. Are you interested?",		"s_6fc5551a":"Thank you. No more work, huh?",		"s_6e5b35c0":"Bah!",		"s_676ef8a2":"I need details.",		"s_668c0704":"It's as good as done!",		"s_6324b0d2":"Yeah, sure. Why not?",		"s_61657d0f":"I see.",		"s_603f6374":"Thank you. [salute]",		"s_406612f9":"I don't know.. the Black Nemesis is more difficult than I expected.",		"s_3c3a1569":"You've done well with the tasks I've given you so far. I still have more work if you're interested. Check back with me in a few seconds. I have to clear another freighter for travel.",		"s_3313e38":"This sounds like a wild goose chase. Ghosts?",		"s_30a4f2c3":"[nods and salutes]",		"s_2a29152c":"I wish it were different. Thank you for all of your hard work.",		"s_28c5432f":"I see you have returned and so quickly! Here is your reward for the tasks you have completed.",		"s_255d3625":"Why are you back already?",		"s_239edf9a":"No... I cannot readily assume it was merely Black Suns attacking our freighters. There has to be something more devious out there! Just let me think... Of course!! I have a second task for you, my friend, if you're up to it.",		"s_21c417c8":"That's sad. Maybe some other time.",		"s_1d52b30":"Ah, my friend. You've cleared all the work I have for you now. However, I didn't forget to process your reward.",		"s_1c914ce3":"I'd rather not take this on quite yet.",		"s_18a00d6a":"Good. Again, I need you to find the Black Suns in the Ghost Tide Nebula, disable them and inspect them for information. Bring any information you find to me. Time is of the essence!",		"s_14b13184":"I failed my mission.",		"s_11ee3ff6":"Oh. I'm sorry. I was rambling. But you're here and that's all that matters. I'm in need of assistance. I need someone brave, intelligent... and someone who is able to think 'outside the box', if you will. Are you that individual?",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (poi_tatooine_general_1.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
