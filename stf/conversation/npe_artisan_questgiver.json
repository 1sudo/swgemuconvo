I can't do it right now.",	"s_32":"I hope that 'someone else' will be more cooperative than you are.",	"s_33":"Yes, quickly. The station is under attack and the shields are failing.

They got into a blaster fight with the guards.",	"s_70":"A blaster shouldn't affect the station's armor plating.",	"s_72":"A disruptor rifle will.
