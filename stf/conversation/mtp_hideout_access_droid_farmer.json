Why won't they grow?",	"s_29":"You here to look at my droids? They've been sabotaged, I guarantee it!",	"s_30":"What seems to be the problem?",	"s_31":"See for yourself...they won't grow.",	"s_32":"They won't...grow?",	"s_33":"That's right. I've tried watering them more often, blocking sunlight, and even talking nicely to them, but nothing had worked. Someone must be sabotaging them.",	"s_34":"Um...okay, I'll take a look.",	"s_35":"Thank you very kindly.",	"s_36":"Nothing. And it doesn't look like sabotage.",	"s_37":"No? Well then, I'm stumped. What could be the problem?",	"s_38":"Er...have you had the soil tested?",	"s_39":"Well I'll be...I never thought of that. What if the soil here won't let me grow droids? Then what am I going to do? Maybe I could plant carbines...",	"s_4":"Did you find anything?",	"s_40":"Maybe they aren't planted deep enough.",	"s_41":"Hmm...maybe. But if I plant them any deeper, no one will be able to see them. It'll just look like an empty field. Like I'm growing dirt or something. My father grew dirt, and I came out here to get away from the family business.",	"s_42":"I don't think you can plant droid parts and have them grow into droids.",	"s_43":"Well, that's crazy. How else would you get a droid? They don't have reproducing parts like people. Only thing left is that they grow in the ground like a plant.",	"s_44":"What kind of fertilizer are you using?",	"s_45":"I was going to use fresh bantha manure, but then I decided on Banthamax 4600-SL synthetic bantha manure with exceptional fertilizing power and realistic manure smell."
