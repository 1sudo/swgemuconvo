Please speak with him so he will cease his whining, and if you haven't already, take care of those saboteurs before speaking with me again.",	"s_25":"Thank you, Colonel.",	"s_26":"I have not fully completed everything I would like to, Colonel.  I prefer to be very thorough.",	"s_27":"Commendable.  Return when you have finished.  I will extend the Empire's gratitude then.",	"s_28":"As per our contract, here is your compensation.  Is there anything else?",	"s_29":"Nothing, Colonel.  Have a good day.",	"s_31":"And you, citizen.",	"s_37":"No.",	"s_38":"I will do my best, Colonel.",	"s_39":"Then I must ask you to leave.",	"s_40":"Yes?  Do you have an appointment?",	"s_41":"Please do.",	"s_42":"Yes, Dathnaeya Loessin made one for me.",	"s_44":"Ah yes.  Here you are. The Nightstrike Soldier Hegemony is looking to join the Empire as a full military branch rather than remain a separate entity.  I would appreciate an objective observer's opinion as to their efficacy.  Officer Loessin recommended you.",	"s_46":"I am honored to help, Colonel.",	"s_48":"The organization calling itself the Aggregate Civil Liberties Organization has shown its true face.  They have taken to sabotaging Imperial shipments.  I would like you to dispense justice on behalf of the Empire to five of these terrorists operating out of the local A.C.L.O. office.",	"s_50":"That is something I can handle for you, Colonel.",	"s_52":"Excellent.  I'd also like for you to see what our, ahem, ally from the Nightstrike Soldier Hegemony might need.  His name is Galiir Ac Yandar.  He is a whining, sniveling, sycophant for which I have no use, but his organization is highly trained and would be an asset to the Empire.  Please fulfill any requests he may have for you.",	"s_54":"I will speak with him.",	"s_56":"Very good, citizen.",	"s_58":"I'm not a police officer, Colonel.  I decline.",	"s_6":"Do you have an appointment?",	"s_60":"Very well.  There is the door.  See your way out.",	"s_62":"No.",	"s_64":"Then I must ask you to leave.",	"s_66":"Greetings citizen.  You do not have an appointment so I must ask you to leave.",	"s_9":"While it has not stopped his complaining, Galiir reports that you have completed the tasks he set for you with great efficiency.  He also reports that he has received word from his agent that the five top saboteurs for the A.C.L.O. have been executed.  You are a credit to your race."
