Chance of a lifetime. Imagine what one could do with something like that...yeah, just imagine.",	"s_12":"Count me in.",	"s_14":"Ah good. Word is that some Imperial captain has hijacked and taken control of a Star Destroyer. I aim to wrest control away from him. For me own purposes, so don't even ask.",	"s_2":"",	"s_4":"I ain't no Imperial or Rebel, so you ain't got no business with me.",	"s_6":"Hmm...that was the easy part. Now don't mistake me...you done real good, but we're still no closer to actually controlling that Star Destroyer. And even more disturbing...apparently you need an entire army to man one of those things. How'm I ever gonna manage that?",	"s_8":"Word is that some Imperial captain has hijacked and taken control of a Star Destroyer. I aim to wrest control away from him.
