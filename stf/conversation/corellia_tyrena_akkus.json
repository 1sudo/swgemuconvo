Why doesn't the stranger leave Akkus alone now?",	"s_18":"Akkus is thankful the stranger has freed us.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Fine, Akkus knows the way. I will tell you, but you must get Akkus out when all of this is over, yes?",	"s_22":"Of course, I plan to get everyone out.",	"s_24":"Yes, yes. Everyone must get out, but especially Akkus, yes?",	"s_26":"Yes, Akkus. Now tell me what you know.",	"s_28":"When they took Akkus to the detention cells, Akkus saw that the surveillance cameras were pointed at the security guards, too. If you could get to the surveillance room, you could possibly see one of the guards use his password, then you could use it too, yes?",	"s_30":"Good idea, Akkus.",	"s_32":"Yes, yes. Akkus have many good ideas. Akkus want to make milk and eggs more available to everyone as well. Akkus not tell you this idea though. You will steal it from Akkus.",	"s_34":"Akkus does not want to talk to the stranger. Leave Akkus.",	"s_6":"You sure don't look like a slave, and you're definitely no guard. So Akkus is thinking what might you be up to here?",	"s_8":"I need to know how to get to the security areas."
