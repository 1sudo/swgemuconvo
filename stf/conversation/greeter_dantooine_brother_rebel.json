		"s_f90ad503":"I see. Thanks!",		"s_f5f72ae1":"My pleasure. Anything else?",		"s_f3ec92a":"Use the planetary map to travel to the vendors listed on it, but not all vendors will be listed there. For the unlisted ones, you'll have to travel around looking for player-owned buildings that hold vendors. Once you've found a vendor, double-click it to see what it has for sale. You can also check bazaar terminals, but the listings on those will only be low-end starships and ship components, if even that.",		"s_f2a4df5e":"Good idea! Thanks.",		"s_f2356ea5":"What's wrong with that?",		"s_eab69714":"Strange. Seems that if they undertook the risk to send you a message, they would make it clear how to respond. Why don't you check your email a little closer.",		"s_e52fbe2d":"He took the last sweesonberry roll without asking if you wanted one?",		"s_e013f498":"Look for the flashing 'envelope' icon on your interface. It's placed on the lower right-hand side of your screen by default.",		"s_da08c873":"That's sort of tricky. There may be some Alliance pilots bold enough to register their locations on the planetary map. Have you looked at the planetary map yet?",		"s_d9231b4f":"There are freelance pilots working in most systems. Some are CorSec pilots, others are part of the RSF of Naboo, and of course, others are smugglers or pirates. I wouldn't recommend those last two if you want to pursue a lengthy career, but, at the same time, some of the best military pilots I know were once smugglers. Most freelance organizations will send recruitment emails. You might try checking your email for something like that.",		"s_d4c6e8cd":"No problem! Anything else?",		"s_d434d6d3":"I appreciate it anyway. Could I help you? Answer some questions about becoming a pilot maybe?",		"s_cf5fc0f":"How do I repair my starship?",		"s_cdb17e79":"How do I check the planetary map?",		"s_cc7c9754":"Don't mention it. Anything else?",		"s_c4682ea6":"Thanks!",		"s_c2db6878":"Good-bye.",		"s_ba95f774":"Bazaar terminals are located all over major cities. Check the areas surrounding major hot spots like the starport, the bank, any of the cantinas, or even the hospitals.",		"s_ba3c26af":"You did? These are desperate times, indeed. The email should probably indicate where you are supposed to go for initial recruitment.",		"s_b641cda6":"Where can I find a bazaar terminal?",		"s_b20f640e":"No, but that's a good guess. That's exactly the kind of thing Fern would do.

No, he joined the Empire and became an Imperial pilot.",		"s_af88e52c":"What!! He ran off with my girlfriend! That son of a kreetle! I can't believe he would do something like that!! Wait a minute, I don't have a girlfriend. No, no, that's not it. That's not it at all.

No, he joined the Empire and became an Imperial pilot.",		"s_add31f19":"I need a starship.",		"s_ad02b6b3":"He ran off with your girlfriend and married her?",		"s_acc368b1":"How do I join the Empire?",		"s_a9850aec":"I got an email from the Alliance!",		"s_a4b89de2":"What's wrong is that I became a Rebel pilot! 

We wanted to join the military and become pilots. But we were supposed to join the same military, not opposed ones. He didn't tell me he was going to join the Empire. How was I supposed to know? And now what do we do?",		"s_a463a3c1":"You're welcome. Anything else?",		"s_9ecb2da9":"Oh sure. What would you like to know?",		"s_9b136077":"That's what Fern keeps insisting. But I'm not sure I trust the Empire. They seem to treat their pilots like fodder by sending wave after wave into battle with no regard for their survival. Fern says that's not the case, but I'm not so sure. And his claims that leaving the Empire might be dangerous do little to boost my confidence. Seriously, I just don't know what to do.",		"s_9354f1d9":"You're a Rebel Pilot. See my brother over here? The one dressed as an Imperial pilot? Look, I know he's made a big mistake joining the Empire and all, but just promise me you won't shoot him. okay? After all, he's still my brother.",		"s_93511893":"Why don't you join the Empire with your brother?",		"s_93280d8a":"Good idea. Thanks!",		"s_91cb4419":"You seem to be upset with your brother?",		"s_8ef8dbfb":"I have another question.",		"s_8cf9be64":"Where can I find a vendor?",		"s_8b37a99a":"How do I make money?",		"s_8b23fac":"I want to learn to fly.",		"s_85e41490":"He became an Imperial pilot while you became a Rebel pilot?",		"s_7ea269a5":"Of all the stubborn, no-account, 'don't bother to say anything to your brother' brothers, mine is definitely the worst! By far. No one else could ever come close.",		"s_7cedb568":"Yeah, that's right. I can't believe you guessed it. Wow.

Anyway, yeah, he became an Imperial pilot and I'm a Rebel pilot. We were supposed to join the same military, not opposed ones. And now I don't know what to do about it.",		"s_778041fd":"Your best bet is to get in touch with the Alliance and sign up for their training program. There are others who will urge you to put your efforts to use in the Empire, but fools will be fools. And most fools are my brother.",		"s_726e332f":"There are all sorts of civilian contracts available on the 'mission terminals' you find throughout town. Look for them near any major structure. Use the terminal to bring up the current list of local contracts. Choose the one that interests you the most, and you'll make money when the task is complete.",		"s_6f0ab63b":"Stay safe, my friend.",		"s_6d792b3f":"Double-click on the envelope icon, and read your mail! Anything else you wanted to ask?",		"s_6bbf120e":"With Fern? Absolutely correct! You'd never guess what that no-brain womp rat went and did? Try and guess. Go ahead and try.",		"s_69796047":"He traded the family bantha for some magic beans?",		"s_68cb68ff":"Is there anyone else I could fly for?",		"s_67d831d4":"Okay, what would you like to know?",		"s_60674236":"Use the command CTRL+V to open the planetary map. On the right-hand side of your display, you will see a listing of trainers by category. All local trainers who register with the planet will appear on this list. Click the 'Trainer' tab and then look for a pilot trainer.",		"s_5eb5a62c":"I can totally relate to that. Things are tough all over thanks to the was between the Empire and the Alliance. A lot of pilots are flying for either the Empire or the Rebellion these days. Ever think of joining the military to get a starship?",		"s_5e410744":"Right-click on the map location to create and activate a waypoint. Follow the waypoint to the trainer's location.",		"s_5dac8809":"You're a Privateer Pilot, aren't you? I'm beginning to wonder if maybe you and my brother Rane had the right idea by not joining the Imperial Navy or the Rebel Navy, and simply staying out of the whole mess. As much as is possible for anyone to stay out of it, anyway.",		"s_5b893f7c":"It does.",		"s_52939a0":"How do I check my email?",		"s_4eb2ac5d":"Good luck, kid! Anything else?",		"s_4c5683f0":"That's what one hears. The Empire has more ships than pilots, and I suspect that it's because they go through pilots faster than a smuggler goes through ale. The Rebels, on the other hand, are known to honor their new pilots with a new ship that will lift them into the reaches of space and beyond.",		"s_495777c0":"Have you checked any vendors? Merchants use vendors to help sell their merchandise. Shipwrights put finished starships and ship components for sale on their vendors, and then you can go to those vendors and purchase what you need.",		"s_47993591":"That I can't answer so well, but Fern could. Stupid moron knows all about joining the Empire. Any other questions?",		"s_472f61d1":"Local space stations are the easiest way to get your ship repaired. When you are heading back here, you should stop at the space station and ask them for repairs. They will provide a quick estimate on what it will take to get you back on track.",		"s_32146025":"Then what?",		"s_30c987fd":"Okay. Anyway, could you answer some questions for me?",		"s_309c383a":"On the lower right-hand side of your screen, there should be a 'letter' icon that is flashing. Double-click on this icon, and it will bring up your personal email. Read over the subject and sender, and scroll through the body text to get all the details.",		"s_3059f369":"What then?",		"s_29894b97":"I don't know how to check.",		"s_27186cee":"I don't have enough money.",		"s_270c87b2":"How do I get them to repair my ship?",		"s_23b94086":"My brother went and became an Imperial pilot. Can you believe that? Well actually, I guess you wouldn't know anything about being a pilot, would you?",		"s_21bf1a8c":"How do I join the Alliance?",		"s_1b178396":"I wish I could help, but I'm stumped.",		"s_1abd933c":"Interesting. Good luck with that. I don't want to get too close to the Galactic Civil War, myself.",		"s_1a06c1df":"It doesn't.",		"s_19aad16e":"No. And you need help. Seriously. What the heck are you talking about? Family bantha? Do we look like ranchers? Please. The magic beans sound cool though.

Anyway, no. He joined the Empire and became an Imperial pilot.",		"s_17bc5d9b":"When you approach the space station, use SHIFT+C to target it and open communication with the commander. You will be asked if you want to purchase repairs or if you want to land on the planet.",		"s_175a8508":"Great, an Imperial Pilot. That's perfect. Why don't you go play Empire somewhere else. This is a family matter.",		"s_144ec5cc":"Sounds good. Thanks!",		"s_12157feb":"The military gives out free ships?",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (greeter_dantooine_brother_rebel.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
