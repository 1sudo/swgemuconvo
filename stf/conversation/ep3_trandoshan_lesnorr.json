But unfortunately I do not have time to chat with you right now. Thanks again, pilot.",	"s_1002":"I received word that you managed to get the convoy through. I knew that you had it in you. I would have loved to see the looks on those resistance furball's faces when you blew them to pieces.",	"s_1004":"It wasn't any problem.",	"s_1006":"Maybe not but I am impressed. Here is a little something extra for your troubles.",	"s_1008":"You look like you are already engaged with a pilot job. Finish that up and then talk to me.",	"s_1010":"I can understand losing a few shuttles but you lost every shuttle in the fleet. I didn't even know that was possible. My profits for this month are completely ruined.",	"s_1012":"Give me another shot. I will get a convoy safely through.",	"s_1014":"I am not entirely sure I should trust you with this again. That convoy cost me plenty of credits but if you can get another on through I should be able to make up for my losses by increasing my prices. Make sure you bring a team with you. Now get up there and protect my convoy.",	"s_1016":"A a pilot...you are a pilot, aren't you? Of course you are. I can tell just by the way you walk...that arrogant strut, smug expressive, air of absolute confidence...no one but a pilot can pull that look off.",	"s_1018":"I know my way around a cockpit. What do you want?",	"s_1020":"I need to hire some guards. Actually I would prefer to hire a team of them. You see I run a group of shuttles that transfer the captured furballs from here up to the Avatar Space Platform. Unfortunately, the resistance has been getting bolder and bolder in attacking our convoys. I need fighter pilots who can protect my shuttles.",	"s_1022":"I could be interested in that.",	"s_1024":"Good. How I run things is that I fill up several shuttles at the same time and send them in convoys to the station. This helps reduce overhead, but also means if I lose a convoy I take a big hit. For every ship you get through I will pay extra and if you can get them all through in one piece I will have a bonus for you.",	"s_1026":"Right. When do we leave?",	"s_1028":"The convoy is ready to launch as soon as it has an escort waiting for it in space. I highly recommend that you put together a few other pilots to help you out on this. The resistance tends to attack in larger forces against a convoy and a single pilot might have trouble keeping those shuttles safe.",	"s_1030":"No thanks, I don't feel like escorting slave shuttles.",	"s_1032":"Suit yourself. I don't want to hire someone who isn't willing to give their all any ways.",	"s_1035":"Sorry but I am looking for some trained pilots to lend me a hand. Until you learn to fly, you are really not very useful to me.",	"s_998":""
