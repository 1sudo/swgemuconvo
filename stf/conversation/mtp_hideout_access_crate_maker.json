Maybe you'll find a clue that I missed. But please don't break any of the crates. Enough damage has already been done.",	"s_12":"Someone has attacked my company and destroyed my precious crates!",	"s_14":"Calm down and tell me what happened.",	"s_16":"I just said...someone has attacked my company and destroyed my precious crates. That's what happened.",	"s_18":"Do you know who did this?",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"No, but it was obviously someone who hates crates. Though it could also have been someone who might have thought the crates contained something worth finding. Like a health pack or maybe some credits. I guess that means just about anyone could have done this.",	"s_22":"Can you think of anything else?",	"s_24":"Oh, they also destroyed some of my crate-making machinery. Which makes no sense because the crates won't have anything inside of them until after they are finished being made. Maybe you should go take a look.",	"s_26":"I am nothing more than a humble crate maker. If people wish to hide bacta injectors or armor power-ups in them, that is their doing...not mine.",	"s_6":"Someone is using my crates as bombs? How dreadful! This will surely mean the end of my business. No one will buy a crate to hide a health pack if they think it will explode!!",	"s_7":"I hope you stop him...no one should make crates that explode. How is someone going to know the ones that explode from the ones that hide something good? He'll ruin the crate business!",	"s_8":"I'm so glad you found all the bombs and stopped the person responsible. Crates are everyone's friend; why would anyone wish them harm?"
