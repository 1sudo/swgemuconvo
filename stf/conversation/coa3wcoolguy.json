We have a number of research stations that are coming under attack from the Empire. I've uploaded a waypoint to your datapad. Head out there and stop the attackers. It will be a hard fight. You might need help.",	"s_19":"I don't have time for this now.",	"s_21":"I'm sorry to hear that. These stations are constantly coming under attack, so come back if you change your mind.",	"s_29":"For this task you must become one of us. Please speak to one of our recruiters and come back to me.

I'm working on it.",	"s_9ebad40b":"We're trying to find an alternative to Alderaanian Flora for the Dead Eye process and have a number of research stations working on the problem. If we succeed we will be able to continue to make Dead Eye. If we can't, Dead Eye will be useless once the current stores of Alderaanian Flora are exhausted.",	"s_a3621ded":"I'm sorry, but we are very busy right now. If you want to help, you should go find one of our Coordinators.",	"s_a4053724":"Did you complete the mission yet?",	"s_a85b1da":"It is so nice to meet you. Your bravery so far has generated quite a bit of conversation in the ranks. Are you ready to do more for the Alliance?",	"s_bb33eb73":"Datapad troubles? That happens. I'll upload a new waypoint to your pad. Good luck.",	"s_c0e4cb7a":"Excellent. We have a number of research stations that are coming under attack from the Empire.

If we are able to finish this research, we will be able to replace the Alderaanian Flora with a suitable alternative and bring Dead Eye to our troops. While the Tactical Officers might have more missions to collect flora, we have asked all of you that we can. You have my personal thanks. May the Force be with you.",	"s_cc92be25":"I'm sorry to hear that. These stations are constantly coming under attack, so come back if you change your mind.",	"s_cf3aed9b":"Good luck then. Come back when you're done.",	"s_d1ae6871":"I don't have time for this now.",	"s_d768eb98":"What is the enemy doing?",	"s_dc616180":"I need to get a new assignment, that last one had a bad waypoint.",	"s_f3080e5":"They have discovered our research stations and have been launching constant attacks against them. They are hoping to hinder our research to the point that Dead Eye will fail."
