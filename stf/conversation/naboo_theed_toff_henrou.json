How about going back to Eckener?",	"s_2":"",	"s_24":"Okay, I'll do it.",	"s_25":"Of course you will. It's not like you ever had a choice.",	"s_34":"It's not every day that we get an opportunity like this one.",	"s_36":"Go to it. What are you stalling for?",	"s_37":"Who would be doing this? It makes no sense. Oh, it's you again. Look, we have no more business, okay. I've got things to do.",	"s_38":"You're here for Eckener, right? Good. Here's the deal: you're going to hit those lousy Darkwalkers where they live. Make sure they feel it. If you do a good job, all debts will be erased and that Eckener kid won't owe us anything. Well, until next time.",	"s_39":"What exactly do you want me to do?",	"s_40":"You're going to attack some Darkwalkers and make them feel some pain. And I think you'll steal me some access codes and some security cards. Unlimited access to their base might come in handy.",	"s_73":"Hmmm, oh yeah. You did good. Really good. Yeah.",	"s_74":"Anything else?",	"s_75":"No. You're done. Go away now, I've got some other things to deal with at the moment."
