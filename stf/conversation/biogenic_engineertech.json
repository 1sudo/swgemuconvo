		"s_f8f36834":"All of the security doors have different locking algorithms. I've had to work on that first door before, so I'm pretty familiar with how it works. However, once you're though there, you're on your own.",		"s_f4e8ce21":"OK, thanks for stopping by.",		"s_eb038dde":"Where could I get one of those keys?",		"s_e61f6f04":"Thank you very much. Come back with the codes and I'll make you a security key.",		"s_df0aaba0":"Only the first door?",		"s_dd67013":"What does that mean?",		"s_dc2e08dd":"OK, what do you need me to do?",		"s_da5959ed":"Is this the datapad that you're talking about?",		"s_d7f1b726":"I'll see what I can do, but I'm not making any promises.",		"s_d4b22fda":"Oh, you're back. We're still trying to get the reactor back online. Not much progress yet, I'm afraid.",		"s_d2de343f":"What is it you would have me do?",		"s_cd2b08bc":"Thank you for the key.",		"s_c8edf6a4":"Oh yes! The computer codes! Now we will be able to get the reactor back online. In exchange for your help, let me give you this key. Since the lockdown is in effect, it will let you get past the first security door.",		"s_c1eda1a3":"I'll give it a try anyway. Good-bye.",		"s_bf0dd8c0":"I'm sorry. I've got to go.",		"s_b8cdda4":"Thanks again for your help. And good luck to you!",		"s_b78f009b":"Alright. Good-bye.",		"s_b3d8b98a":"Alright, I'll come back when I've found your assistant.",		"s_aa71d09d":"I need to you to find my assistant, and bring his datapad back here to me. If you can get me those codes, I'll see if I can wire you a key that will let you through the first security door.",		"s_a7b6a9c7":"I'm supposed to give this datapad to you.",		"s_a767cb3c":"Is there anything that I can do to help?",		"s_a3101911":"Why, uh... yes it is! Here are the codes! And as promised, here is a key that will let you past the first security door.",		"s_9d6ccb86":"I'm just leaving.",		"s_99c2fa91":"I just sort of wandered in, I guess.",		"s_9541ca42":"Actually, now that you mention it, there is. We have the materials here to repair the reactor, but I can't bring it online without the computer codes. My assistant currently has the codes on his datapad, but I don't know where he is.",		"s_94350653":"Alright, well thanks anyway. But don't forget that you won't be able to go much farther into the facility without a key to disable that security door.",		"s_926a3bb3":"Sounds pretty bad. I'll leave you alone.",		"s_8e26cc3d":"Well, I hope you get it fixed. Good bye.",		"s_8c024a43":"We've got things under control here now. You'd better go see if anyone else needs help. Thanks again.",		"s_884784be":"I see. Thank you for your help.",		"s_76e305ae":"Come back as soon as you find it, and I'll get you a key for that security door.",		"s_75c607ac":"My assistant has some computer codes that we need to restart the reactor. If you bring me his datapad with those codes, I will gladly make you a security key.",		"s_69a2ad00":"Well, alright. Good-bye then.",		"s_6569e789":"We could certainly use the help, that's for sure. That earthquake knocked out our power reactor and we're rapidly losing power throughout the complex.",		"s_5fe76a83":"You've wandered into a bad spot I'm afraid. That earthquake knocked out our power reactor and we're rapidly losing power throughout the complex.",		"s_5afc1718":"Alright, good luck!",		"s_5933b1d0":"I could easily make you a key to get you past the first security door, but I would ask you to do something for me first.",		"s_56fde3ca":"I'm trying to help secure the facility.",		"s_4fe2bd07":"And thank you for yours. Good luck to you!",		"s_4c14f9fb":"Yes, I hope so too.",		"s_428087e9":"What's happening here?",		"s_3d90816":"Blast, the coolant pump is offline too. We'll need to get that... oh, what are you doing here?",		"s_347a730":"Unfortunately, that means that the power to our containment system failed. No doubt you've probably seen some pretty fearsome creatures wandering around.",		"s_30c757f6":"What else has been affected?",		"s_2c2921ad":"Were you able to find my apprentice? Did you get the datapad?",		"s_27707b65":"No, I haven't gotten the datapad yet.",		"s_235c610d":"That earthquake we just had knocked out our power reactor. The backup system came online, but we're rapidly losing power throughout the complex.",		"s_1615f465":"It looks like the security grid is offline too. I don't know how that will effect the sentry droids, but the security doors are probably locked down. Without a special key you wouldn't be able to get much further into the complex.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (biogenic_engineertech.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
