It was an antique, and someone's taken it off the planet.  He wants to get it back, but isn't sure how to go about it.",	"s_14":"Where have you looked for the rifle?",	"s_16":"We've checked everywhere on Tatooine.  Huff tried some of his contacts on Corellia but they were no help.  Personally I think it's on Naboo.",	"s_18":"What do you know about the rifle?",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"I hear some criminals got hold of it.  The criminal element has lots to do with these things, when stuff disappears you know?",	"s_23":"Maybe I can find it for you.",	"s_24":"That would be fantastic. If I were you I'd start with Borvo the Hutt, on Naboo. He's sort of like Jabba, but not nearly as mean. He may know where it is.",	"s_26":"Who is Mr. Darklighter?",	"s_28":"Huff Darklighter?  The head of the Darklighter estate?  He's only the biggest business magnate on Tatooine.  Where have you been?",	"s_30":"Never heard of him.",	"s_32":"Well, I suggest you take your head out of the sand and look around you.",	"s_34":"So, what's he so upset about?",	"s_4":"Hello, friend. Good work on finding Huff's rifle. You can go talk to Huff now.",	"s_6":"I've told you already, you can't get in to see Huff until you bring me his grandfather's rifle. Just hand it to me when you have it.",	"s_8":"Sorry, no one gets in to see Mr. Darklighter."
