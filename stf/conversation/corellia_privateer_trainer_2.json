Report back when you're done.  When you're SUCCESSFUL this time.",	"s_126":"(laugh)",	"s_12da4881":"Yeah, well, they can't all be gems.  Anyway I'd better get back to work.  Take care, %NU.",	"s_131":"Not really",	"s_135":"Yes",	"s_13b10809":"Travel to Lok Space and protect a transport that has gotten between some Imperial and Rebels.",	"s_140":"You're right",	"s_142":"Of course I'm right!  Now don't you hesitate to see me again the very moment you're available for duty.",	"s_144":"Of course!",	"s_155":"Thanks",	"s_158a5883":"I don't believe you",	"s_158b60f":"Just fine",	"s_163ba63a":"You've earned it!  Now go out on the town and catch yourself some rest and relaxation.  You look terrible!",	"s_169":"What?",	"s_169df3bb":"Never mind.",	"s_173":"(laugh)",	"s_178d46a1":"Good.  Choose an assignment.",	"s_18206937":"I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.  Not get back to Yavin and complete your mission!",	"s_184":"Will do",	"s_190":"Good luck!",	"s_19104bb":"I don't have all the details.  Suffice to say that sometimes CorSec needs to be a little more proactive.  We can't always wait for trouble to come to us.",	"s_1c0972b6":"Did you get the shipment orders?",	"s_1c81fc8b":"Or how about this:  It says 'Problem:  Hyperdrive volume is unbelievably loud'.... 'Solution:  Hyperdrive volume adjusted to more believable level.'",	"s_1c8bddbb":"What is it?",	"s_1d843b61":"You're much too good a pilot to waste on the trivial tasks that I could assign you.  We need you in Lok.  Now!",	"s_1e666f74":"Equipment malfunction",	"s_1f3b7ea2":"Git!",	"s_225d3518":"What are you waiting for?",	"s_237":"Destroy Duty",	"s_244":"No problem",	"s_252":"Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to go tell our maintenance crew to straighten up. They're a bunch of jokers and starship maintenance is no laughing matter!",	"s_253":"What kind of training?",	"s_254":"Let's see. I think today we'll talk about advanced starfighters.",	"s_255":"Hm. Why don't we teach you a little about intermediate starship components.",	"s_256":"I think it's high time you learned about starship defense techniques.",	"s_257":"How about reactor engineering algorithms? Doesn't that sound interesting?",	"s_259":"Alright.",	"s_261":"Good choice.  Now I have a special assignment for you!  Go to Dantooine Space and destroy a Hutt Transport.  The Hutts are making a large spice shipment through that system and we do not intend to let it reach its destination, which could very well be Corellia.",	"s_263":"What if it's not bound for Corellia?",	"s_264b3207":"You said it!",	"s_265":"Meh.",	"s_267":"Alright.",	"s_269":"Good choice.  Now I have a special assignment for you.  Fly to Lok and inspect a Nym Cannon Ship for Shipment Orders.",	"s_26de1778":"You don't believe me?",	"s_271":"What kind of orders?",	"s_273":"That's what we want to know... Just what is he shipping around, and who is he doing it for... and that's what you're going to find out!",	"s_275":"Alright.",	"s_277":"Good choice.  Your new abilities will come in handy for this next assignment.  Go escort a freighter through Yavin Space against Rebel aggressions.",	"s_279":"We're fighting the Rebel Alliance now?",	"s_281":"No, no, of course not.  Corellia is officially neutral in this little war.  But if they think that means they and the Empire can divide every resource in the galaxy then they've got another think comin'.",	"s_283":"Alright.",	"s_285":"Good choice.  No doubt that will come in handy for this next assignment. We want you to disrupt operations for Nym in his home system.  Go destroy spacecraft under his control.",	"s_285c3698":"I do have some elective duty missions, actually. They're not the most exciting work, but they do need to be done. Take a look and tell me what you want to do.",	"s_287":"Why Nym?",	"s_289":"Because although he's not the worst pirate in the world, he does a fair bit of smuggling, piracy and assorted other criminal acts.  If we're going to have to tangle with his thugs, we'd rather do it on his own turf.",	"s_28ea80d":"Recovery Duty",	"s_2d247e7b":"Ha ha!  Ok, I made that last one up...  But there is SOME kind of comedian working in the maintenance hangar!",	"s_2ef8d174":"Look, the key to success is to shoot the enemy before the enemy shoots you.  Now get back to Dantooine and kill that spicer!",	"s_30":"Go on",	"s_30350c6":"I've heard it.",	"s_315cee58":"Of course I'm right!  Now don't you hesitate to see me again the very moment you're available for duty.",	"s_32103432":"I have a special assignment for you.  Fly to Lok and inspect a Nym Cannon Ship for Shipment Orders.",	"s_322b6b69":"No, what about it?",	"s_32e9d36a":"Can't it wait?",	"s_33":"Then what happened?",	"s_334bc":"Hey now!  Are you threatening me?  I'll have you know this old slice hound still has a bite.",	"s_346ddf":"You know Corellia's officially neutral in the civil war, right?  Well the Imperials seem to have a hard time remembering that.  Go out there and 'remind' them they aren't welcome as a military power in the Corellia system.",	"s_36961caf":"Wrong answer, %NU.  But I'll give you a hint, it involves you, Dantooine, a spice runner, and a successful mission.",	"s_370822d1":"Yes",	"s_3880d2bf":"I need a hyperdrive",	"s_39bc34a9":"Hey, %NU, did I tell you about the maintenance report I just received?",	"s_3a126327":"No plan survives initial contact with the enemy!  But I take it you were successful anyway.  I'll credit your bank for services rendered.",	"s_3b2fdc7f":"Will do!  Thanks!",	"s_3b83352c":"On my way",	"s_3cfd3bb4":"You'd BETTER stop mocking me",	"s_3e869ab":"Good!  How about NOW?  Is NOW good for you?",	"s_4":"Everything is fine here. Nothing wrong here at all.",	"s_40e66be3":"I'll try",	"s_41e79b8c":"Woah!  Woah!  Woah!  Slow down, there!  I was just kidding around with you.  Take it easy!",	"s_447b4291":"%TU!  Long time no see.  I've heard Commander Ramna was quite pleased with your performance.",	"s_44bc6772":"Fantastic.  Don't forget:  If the enemy is within range, so are you.",	"s_457a7010":"No",	"s_46cf37e9":"The Imperial just shrugged and said, 'Yeah, that's what your buddies were trying to tell me.'",	"s_47fde4be":"The Imperial just shrugs and says, 'Oh really, I didn't know that.'  So the Corellian goes back to his buddies and tells them, 'I insulted Darth Vader and he didn't even care'.",	"s_485284b6":"I'll try again",	"s_4e3437a8":"Oh, YOU'RE busy.  You think I don't work here?  Come talk to me when you're ready for an assignment.",	"s_4e6f47aa":"Oh.  Ok... heh, guess I'm getting to be old, telling the same old jokes over and over.",	"s_4e94fa0f":"Try again?",	"s_501489d2":"All according to plan",	"s_513aa336":"No I'm not.  And they get worse!  This one says 'Problem:  Boosters not operational.' and then 'Solution:  Boosters will not work in OFF mode.'",	"s_51b81b00":"They were too strong for me",	"s_523e23b2":"Here I am!",	"s_52467dab":"I'll destroy them",	"s_529c014":"You're a cold man, %TU.  Come see me when you're ready for your next assignment.",	"s_530a5a44":"Are you insane?  The weather there is terrible, the food tastes awful and the locals are all rude.  Talus is practically a backwater compared to Corellia.",	"s_53b9240e":"Ha ha!  Ok, enough goofing off.  I better get back to work.  Enjoy your visit to Corellia.",	"s_53de9d8f":"Like what?",	"s_546d249e":"You're a cold woman, %NU.  Come see me when you're ready for your next assignment.",	"s_56e162f2":"Escort Duty",	"s_5715d65c":"Lots.  What do you WANT to do?",	"s_584a90f8":"You've done an excellent job for me, %NU.  I can see that you are ready for some training.",	"s_5b1bed8b":"Well?",	"s_5b5ed110":"Pilot error",	"s_5d262b71":"You are here for work now, yes?",	"s_5d3166b9":"Everything is fine here. Nothing wrong at all.",	"s_5e86fa24":"Well, soldier, how did things go?",	"s_5fa9a5d3":"Thanks",	"s_60fbb41a":"I like you.  You remind me of when I was young and stupid.  Listen up, you'd better start taking this job seriously!  We need those orders.  Go get them.  Now!",	"s_61189bfc":"One work-order for the maintenance crew lists the problem as 'Something in cockpit is loose'.  Guess what the maintenance workers wrote as the solution?",	"s_622194e2":"I know that's not the most glamorous assignment, but when duty calls, we've got to answer.  Am I right?  Or am I right?",	"s_658107f":"I can see you're busy.  Come talk to me when you've got some time.  I can always use your services.",	"s_65c6992e":"Yes, I am ready.",	"s_6782f928":"Excuses, excuses.  Maybe you need to stop buying your equipment from the lowest bidder.  Splurge a little.  Get something that won't break-down on you.  And then get back to Dantooine and destroy that spicer!",	"s_6adcde65":"How did that escort go?",	"s_6adec6b0":"Of course!",	"s_6d4db3b5":"What's wrong with the one you've got?",	"s_6f9a9967":"I blew it to bits",	"s_71b485e4":"Then don't just stand around here talking to me, get back to Yavin and see that the ship makes it through!",	"s_72":"What happened?",	"s_7282cf08":"Oh yes, I know what you mean... there's no place like Corellia.",	"s_74f806bd":"Just visiting",	"s_76c3352e":"So, one of the Corellians walked over to the Imperial, taps him on the shoulder, and says, 'Hey, I hear your Darth Vader is a spice-fiend.'",	"s_771cfc6b":"Escort mission a success?",	"s_7b2e95f6":"I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.  No it can't 'wait'!  You think they're just going to cruise around waiting for you to go blow 'em up.  Get out there!",	"s_7b7644f7":"Nonsense!  You can do this!  Go back to Dantooine and eliminate that spice runner!",	"s_7b7fb169":"It's not that I don't think you'd do a good job, but I don't have anything to assign right now. You may want to try talking to your own contacts.",	"s_7f5b2aa":"Fantastic!  And remember, if you lose contact with the enemy, look behind you.",	"s_80ccf8a6":"Not quite yet.",	"s_80e4a5f8":"Well come on, %NU.  I was born at night, but not LAST night!",	"s_8125b624":"Looking for Adwan Turoldine",	"s_81b96b70":"We want you to disrupt operations for Nym in his home system.  Go destroy spacecraft under his control.",	"s_82d13497":"I'm busy",	"s_82d6265":"Bwaahahahaaha!  Oh I really had you going, there!  I thought you were going to hit me!",	"s_8416980e":"Perfect!  I'll turn these over to Intelligence.  I've got your payment right here.",	"s_84be4b94":"Why Lok?",	"s_84cdd613":"Something like that",	"s_8694eb3f":"You're right about that!  Unfortunately I don't have any better ships to spare.  You'll just have to buy a better ship yourself.",	"s_87bedbc6":"Well, if it isn't %TU. I've heard your name around the pilot's lounge a few times. What can I do for you?",	"s_8aec791d":"Correct in one guess!  Let me know how it goes.",	"s_8bec44d9":"Oh really... then tell me, WHY DIDN'T IT ARRIVE?  I think you'd better get back to Yavin and take care of business!",	"s_8c0b08bf":"That's right, 'never mind'!  Another outburst like that and I'll have you on report!",	"s_8cd19baf":"Nym's ships have been expanding their operations all the way out to Yavin 4.  We want to put a stop to that, but more importantly we want to recover the cargo he's been swiping from Corellian freighters!  Go recover that cargo in the Yavin system!",	"s_8e2edcbe":"If you say so.",	"s_8e80e129":"%NU!  My favorite pilot.  Did you stop the transport?",	"s_8ed520f1":"That was terrible",	"s_8f8348b9":"You don't have to yell",	"s_900f01d1":"What?",	"s_906e4829":"Next time I'll rip your arms off",	"s_920404b6":"Those can't be real reports",	"s_9208410d":"...",	"s_93":"Yes",	"s_95667986":"Do what you need to do, then hurry up and come back. We need your help.",	"s_98dba2b6":"I need a better ship",	"s_99251349":"(Laugh)",	"s_9b99e4ac":"Can't I just do some duty missions for you?",	"s_9be69a2e":"I LIKE you, %NU.  You've got the tenacity of a Bull Rancor!  But enough of this joking around... I've got to get back to work.",	"s_9e4b1a6c":"You are not a very good liar, %NU.  And that's good, since you don't seem to be a very good pilot, either.  Now get back to Lok and get us those shipment orders!",	"s_9e576266":"OK, ok!",	"s_9e85f6f2":"Why not?  We've got bad guys to catch, stolen cargo to recover, Imperial oppression to resist... you think Corellia is just going to magically secure itself?",	"s_9f5f269":"No problem",	"s_a34ecd3":"Alright.  Well, I better get back to work.  Don't be a stranger!",	"s_a5293421":"One of his buddies says, 'You just don't know how to get to him.  Watch this.' and he goes over to the Imperial and says, 'Hey, I hear your Darth Vader was a lying, cheating, idiotic, low-life scum!'  But the Imperial still just shrugs and says, 'Oh, really?  I didn't know that.'",	"s_a635c8aa":"Turoldine?  Why... he's stationed on Dantooine, I think.  Not Corellia!  Look for him in the Mining outpost.",	"s_a785d6d0":"Then you'd best be on your way, right?  Back to Lok!  Get those orders!  No time like the present!",	"s_a80d9308":"Good luck!",	"s_a87fc3e8":"I want you to travel to Lok and see Commander Ramna.  She'll probably be holed-up in Nym's cantina...",	"s_a9839037":"No, it just malfunctioned",	"s_aad866ad":"You'll just have to learn to deal with it... or buy a better ship.  Now are you ready for work or not?",	"s_aba61e8d":"Hey, stop me if you've heard this one.  Three Corellians see an Imperial at the starport.",	"s_ac638560":"Ha ha!  Ok, I made that last one up...  But there is some kind of comedian working in the maintenance hangar!",	"s_aeca6ebc":"I have the shipment orders",	"s_af6c7acb":"I don't mind",	"s_b09fd902":"You're doing well, Pilot. But there is still more to be done. Are you ready to get back to work?",	"s_b0a6b1e2":"How about this one: 'Dead bugs found on windshield.'  Solution:  'Live bugs on order'.",	"s_b31da30c":"Not very well",	"s_b3b93f51":"Oh, you really had me going there.  I thought you were going to rip my arms out the sockets.  Enough joking around though, I've got to get back to work.",	"s_b3c84ab4":"Then what happened?",	"s_b60183cf":"Go escort a freighter through Yavin Space against Rebel aggressions.",	"s_b6a04af3":"Roooaaaaaawwwwr!!!",	"s_b6b1c40a":"Not really",	"s_b978843d":"I'm looking for a mission. Do you have anything I can do?",	"s_b9fa1db9":"She can be a tough one to work with, but she's a good officer.  Anyway, what brings you back to Corellia?",	"s_ba11bd82":"And?",	"s_baddec82":"Oh that's terrible.  You've got to get back to Lok and destroy that ship!",	"s_bc8bf5b3":"Never mind",	"s_bc99a4d2":"It's weak!",	"s_bcdf778f":"Ok, see ya.",	"s_be500111":"Don't get all huffy!  You're doing a fine job for Corellian Security and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!",	"s_c16a57f5":"Good job!  Nothing more satisfying than that, right?  I've got your pay right here.... along with some news.",	"s_c261cfae":"No problem.",	"s_c545bb40":"No I am not",	"s_c66d1ef2":"If you're expecting I won't set my rank aside for the two seconds it takes to give you a beating, you had better think again!",	"s_c7b73029":"Don't worry, %NU... there won't be a next time... I'll remember not to mess around with you.",	"s_c9a83e17":"Oh come on!",	"s_ccadbca4":"Enough joking around though, %NU.  I've got to get back to work.",	"s_cd482bef":"I lied, I didn't get them",	"s_cfa2d559":"Will do",	"s_d21a7a71":"I failed",	"s_d24a2285":"Will do.",	"s_d338fc9a":"And what are you going to do about it?",	"s_d52f0739":"That's what I thought!  Now get out of here and spend your hard-earned pay on Vasarian Brandy and Dancers.  Ha ha!",	"s_d73a1a1e":"I was!",	"s_d8652774":"I have a special assignment for you!  Go to Dantooine Space and destroy a Hutt Transport.  The Hutts are making a large spice shipment through that system and we do not intend to let it reach its destination, which could very well be Corellia.",	"s_da7c5706":"I'm not a mercenary!",	"s_db7bbbdf":"You're about to bite off more than you can chew, %TU!",	"s_dd46f361":"Well that explains the way you dress.  So, PILOT, was the mission a success?",	"s_df44b897":"Oh tell me another one!",	"s_e00ac98e":"What happened up there?",	"s_e107077e":"Yes I am",	"s_e119b0aa":"Yeah.  These are tough times, though.  We've got to preserve Corellian interests no matter WHAT it takes.",	"s_e3064ba1":"Equipment malfunction?!  Let me guess... someone shot your equipment and it exploded?",	"s_e5e96bc7":"Head up to Corellia Space and destroy some Hidden Daggers.  Those pirates have been getting a little too bold lately.",	"s_e6e4f8fe":"That's the stuff.  Here's your pay.  Personally I don't care much for fighting the Rebel Alliance OR the Imperial Navy... seems like too great an opportunity for Corellia to be swept into this war.",	"s_ea178ddb":"Talus is like Corellia",	"s_eb93536d":"Funny",	"s_ec084dd3":"Go on",	"s_ecba0095":"What's the good word, %NU?",	"s_eea02eca":"You're kidding?",	"s_eef93168":"I don't like it either",	"s_f0adaca2":"I'm not scared of you",	"s_f1679a90":"(laugh)",	"s_f1e77b0c":"Good!  But just remember, no plan ever survives contact with the enemy.",	"s_f3327326":"Ok, hand them over.",	"s_f43089c2":"Excellent!  Good luck, %NU.  And remember, Experience is something you don't get until after you need it.",	"s_f52a7b2d":"I'm a pilot, not a soldier",	"s_f613ccdb":"Ok, what can I do?",	"s_f68c028e":"Well then, you've earned your daily credit.  Here you are.  Let me know when you're in need of more work.",	"s_f7394720":"That's the spirit!  Good luck!  And don't worry, some day we'll look back on this, laugh nervously and change the subject.",	"s_f8842e94":"So he goes back to his Corellian buddies and says, 'You're right!  That guy is unshakable!'  And the third Corellian says, 'I'll get him.  Watch this.'  And he goes over to the Imperial, taps him on the shoulder and says, 'Hey, I heard Darth Vader was a Corellian!'",	"s_f96e5915":"It's true!",	"s_f9c365f7":"I don't know",	"s_f9f9a99":"It says, 'Something in cockpit tightened.'",	"s_fa5c5669":"Destroy Duty",	"s_fb40feab":"I'm starting to think our maintenance crew is on the spice.  You wouldn't believe some of these 'solutions' they've entered, here.",	"s_fb8ba48a":"I lost them",	"s_fc079db2":"Still the cocky one, aren't you?  Anyway, what brings you back to Corellia?",	"s_fd2e713f":"Oh, you're just working out of a sense of duty to Corellia, huh?  Committed to keeping the planet free of outside influence and that sort of thing.  You expect me to believe that?",	"s_fecb2cbb":"You're right"
