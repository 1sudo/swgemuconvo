		"s_fecb2cbb":"You're right",		"s_fd2e713f":"Oh, you're just working out of a sense of duty to Corellia, huh?  Committed to keeping the planet free of outside influence and that sort of thing.  You expect me to believe that?",		"s_fc079db2":"Still the cocky one, aren't you?  Anyway, what brings you back to Corellia?",		"s_fb8ba48a":"I lost them",		"s_fb40feab":"I'm starting to think our maintenance crew is on the spice.  You wouldn't believe some of these 'solutions' they've entered, here.",		"s_fa5c5669":"Destroy Duty",		"s_f9f9a99":"It says, 'Something in cockpit tightened.'",		"s_f9c365f7":"I don't know",		"s_f96e5915":"It's true!",		"s_f8842e94":"So he goes back to his Corellian buddies and says, 'You're right!  That guy is unshakable!'  And the third Corellian says, 'I'll get him.  Watch this.'  And he goes over to the Imperial, taps him on the shoulder and says, 'Hey, I heard Darth Vader was a Corellian!'",		"s_f7394720":"That's the spirit!  Good luck!  And don't worry, some day we'll look back on this, laugh nervously and change the subject.",		"s_f68c028e":"Well then, you've earned your daily credit.  Here you are.  Let me know when you're in need of more work.",		"s_f613ccdb":"Ok, what can I do?",		"s_f52a7b2d":"I'm a pilot, not a soldier",		"s_f43089c2":"Excellent!  Good luck, %NU.  And remember, Experience is something you don't get until after you need it.",		"s_f3327326":"Ok, hand them over.",		"s_f1e77b0c":"Good!  But just remember, no plan ever survives contact with the enemy.",		"s_f1679a90":"(laugh)",		"s_f0adaca2":"I'm not scared of you",		"s_eef93168":"I don't like it either",		"s_eea02eca":"You're kidding?",		"s_ecba0095":"What's the good word, %NU?",		"s_ec084dd3":"Go on",		"s_eb93536d":"Funny",		"s_ea178ddb":"Talus is like Corellia",		"s_e6e4f8fe":"That's the stuff.  Here's your pay.  Personally I don't care much for fighting the Rebel Alliance OR the Imperial Navy... seems like too great an opportunity for Corellia to be swept into this war.",		"s_e5e96bc7":"Head up to Corellia Space and destroy some Hidden Daggers.  Those pirates have been getting a little too bold lately.",		"s_e3064ba1":"Equipment malfunction?!  Let me guess... someone shot your equipment and it exploded?",		"s_e119b0aa":"Yeah.  These are tough times, though.  We've got to preserve Corellian interests no matter WHAT it takes.",		"s_e107077e":"Yes I am",		"s_e00ac98e":"What happened?",		"s_df44b897":"Oh tell me another one!",		"s_dd46f361":"Well that explains the way you dress.  So, PILOT, was the mission a success?",		"s_db7bbbdf":"You're about to bite off more than you can chew, %TU!",		"s_da7c5706":"I'm not a mercenary!",		"s_d8652774":"I have a special assignment for you!  Go to Dantooine Space and destroy a Hutt Transport.  The Hutts are making a large spice shipment through that system and we do not intend to let it reach its destination, which could very well be Corellia.",		"s_d73a1a1e":"I was!",		"s_d52f0739":"That's what I thought!  Now get out of here and spend your hard-earned pay on Vasarian Brandy and Dancers.  Ha ha!",		"s_d338fc9a":"And what are you going to do about it?",		"s_d24a2285":"Will do.",		"s_d21a7a71":"I failed",		"s_cfa2d559":"Will do",		"s_cd54e85d":"Because although he's not the worst pirate in the world, he does a fair bit of smuggling, piracy and assorted other criminal acts.  If we're going to have to tangle with his thugs, we'd rather do it on his own turf.",		"s_cd482bef":"I lied, I didn't get them",		"s_ccadbca4":"Enough joking around though, %NU.  I've got to get back to work.",		"s_c9a83e17":"Oh come on!",		"s_c7b73029":"Don't worry, %NU... there won't be a next time... I'll remember not to mess around with you.",		"s_c66d1ef2":"If you're expecting I won't set my rank aside for the two seconds it takes to give you a beating, you had better think again!",		"s_c6673868":"I want to learn about starship defense techniques.",		"s_c545bb40":"No I am not",		"s_c42bff89":"Why Nym?",		"s_c261cfae":"No problem.",		"s_c1ef4b1":"Good choice.  Now I have a special assignment for you.  Fly to Lok and inspect a Nym Cannon Ship for Shipment Orders.",		"s_c16a57f5":"Good job!  Nothing more satisfying than that, right?  I've got your pay right here.... along with some news.",		"s_bf7ea071":"I want to learn about advanced fighters.",		"s_be500111":"Don't get all huffy!  You're doing a fine job for Corellian Security and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!",		"s_bcdf778f":"Ok, see ya.",		"s_bc99a4d2":"It's weak!",		"s_bc8bf5b3":"Never mind",		"s_baddec82":"Oh that's terrible.  You've got to get back to Lok and destroy that ship!",		"s_ba11bd82":"And?",		"s_b9fa1db9":"She can be a tough one to work with, but she's a good officer.  Anyway, what brings you back to Corellia?",		"s_b978843d":"I'm looking for a mission. Do you have anything I can do?",		"s_b6b1c40a":"Not really",		"s_b6a04af3":"Roooaaaaaawwwwr!!!",		"s_b60183cf":"Go escort a freighter through Yavin Space against Rebel aggressions.",		"s_b41e5c00":"Meh.",		"s_b3c84ab4":"Then what happened?",		"s_b3b93f51":"Oh, you really had me going there.  I thought you were going to rip my arms out the sockets.  Enough joking around though, I've got to get back to work.",		"s_b31da30c":"Not very well",		"s_b0a6b1e2":"How about this one: 'Dead bugs found on windshield.'  Solution:  'Live bugs on order'.",		"s_b09fd902":"You're doing well, Pilot. But there is still more to be done. Are you ready to get back to work?",		"s_af6c7acb":"I don't mind",		"s_aeca6ebc":"I have the shipment orders",		"s_ac638560":"Ha ha!  Ok, I made that last one up...  But there is some kind of comedian working in the maintenance hangar!",		"s_aba61e8d":"Hey, stop me if you've heard this one.  Three Corellians see an Imperial at the starport.",		"s_aad866ad":"You'll just have to learn to deal with it... or buy a better ship.  Now are you ready for work or not?",		"s_aa58928c":"I want to learn about reactor engineering algorithms.",		"s_a9839037":"No, it just malfunctioned",		"s_a87fc3e8":"I want you to travel to Lok and see Commander Ramna.  She'll probably be holed-up in Nym's cantina...",		"s_a80d9308":"Good luck!",		"s_a785d6d0":"Then you'd best be on your way, right?  Back to Lok!  Get those orders!  No time like the present!",		"s_a635c8aa":"Turoldine?  Why... he's stationed on Dantooine, I think.  Not Corellia!  Look for him in the Mining outpost.",		"s_a5293421":"One of his buddies says, 'You just don't know how to get to him.  Watch this.' and he goes over to the Imperial and says, 'Hey, I hear your Darth Vader was a lying, cheating, idiotic, low-life scum!'  But the Imperial still just shrugs and says, 'Oh, really?  I didn't know that.'",		"s_a34ecd3":"Alright.  Well, I better get back to work.  Don't be a stranger!",		"s_9f5f269":"No problem",		"s_9e85f6f2":"Why not?  We've got bad guys to catch, stolen cargo to recover, Imperial oppression to resist... you think Corellia is just going to magically secure itself?",		"s_9e576266":"OK, ok!",		"s_9e4b1a6c":"You are not a very good liar, %NU.  And that's good, since you don't seem to be a very good pilot, either.  Now get back to Lok and get us those shipment orders!",		"s_9be69a2e":"I LIKE you, %NU.  You've got the tenacity of a Bull Rancor!  But enough of this joking around... I've got to get back to work.",		"s_9b99e4ac":"Can't I just do some duty missions for you?",		"s_99251349":"(Laugh)",		"s_98dba2b6":"I need a better ship",		"s_95667986":"Do what you need to do, then hurry up and come back. We need your help.",		"s_9208410d":"...",		"s_920404b6":"Those can't be real reports",		"s_906e4829":"Next time I'll rip your arms off",		"s_900f01d1":"What?",		"s_8f8348b9":"You don't have to yell",		"s_8ed520f1":"That was terrible",		"s_8e80e129":"%NU!  My favorite pilot.  Did you stop the transport?",		"s_8e2edcbe":"If you say so.",		"s_8cd19baf":"Nym's ships have been expanding their operations all the way out to Yavin 4.  We want to put a stop to that, but more importantly we want to recover the cargo he's been swiping from Corellian freighters!  Go recover that cargo in the Yavin system!",		"s_8c0b08bf":"That's right, 'never mind'!  Another outburst like that and I'll have you on report!",		"s_8c00922e":"What if it's not bound for Corellia?",		"s_8bec44d9":"Oh really... then tell me, WHY DIDN'T IT ARRIVE?  I think you'd better get back to Yavin and take care of business!",		"s_8aec791d":"Correct in one guess!  Let me know how it goes.",		"s_8860b099":"Good choice.  No doubt that will come in handy for this next assignment. We want you to disrupt operations for Nym in his home system.  Go destroy spacecraft under his control.",		"s_87bedbc6":"Well, if it isn't %TU. I've heard your name around the pilot's lounge a few times. What can I do for you?",		"s_8694eb3f":"You're right about that!  Unfortunately I don't have any better ships to spare.  You'll just have to buy a better ship yourself.",		"s_84cdd613":"Something like that",		"s_84be4b94":"Why Lok?",		"s_8416980e":"Perfect!  I'll turn these over to Intelligence.  I've got your payment right here.",		"s_82e1c248":"What kind of orders?",		"s_82d6265":"Bwaahahahaaha!  Oh I really had you going, there!  I thought you were going to hit me!",		"s_82d13497":"I'm busy",		"s_81b96b70":"We want you to disrupt operations for Nym in his home system.  Go destroy spacecraft under his control.",		"s_8125b624":"Looking for Adwan Turoldine",		"s_80e4a5f8":"Well come on, %NU.  I was born at night, but not LAST night!",		"s_80ccf8a6":"Not quite yet.",		"s_7f5b2aa":"Fantastic!  And remember, if you lose contact with the enemy, look behind you.",		"s_7d351971":"No, no, of course not.  Corellia is officially neutral in this little war.  But if they think that means they and the Empire can divide every resource in the galaxy then they've got another think comin'.",		"s_7b7fb169":"It's not that I don't think you'd do a good job, but I don't have anything to assign right now. You may want to try talking to your own contacts.",		"s_7b7644f7":"Nonsense!  You can do this!  Go back to Dantooine and eliminate that spice runner!",		"s_7b2e95f6":"I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.  No it can't 'wait'!  You think they're just going to cruise around waiting for you to go blow 'em up.  Get out there!",		"s_771cfc6b":"Escort mission a success?",		"s_76c3352e":"So, one of the Corellians walked over to the Imperial, taps him on the shoulder, and says, 'Hey, I hear your Darth Vader is a spice-fiend.'",		"s_74f806bd":"Just visiting",		"s_737b617c":"I want to learn about intermediate starship components.",		"s_7282cf08":"Oh yes, I know what you mean... there's no place like Corellia.",		"s_71b485e4":"Then don't just stand around here talking to me, get back to Yavin and see that the ship makes it through!",		"s_6f9a9967":"I blew it to bits",		"s_6d4db3b5":"What's wrong with the one you've got?",		"s_6adec6b0":"Of course!",		"s_6adcde65":"How did that escort go?",		"s_6782f928":"Excuses, excuses.  Maybe you need to stop buying your equipment from the lowest bidder.  Splurge a little.  Get something that won't break-down on you.  And then get back to Dantooine and destroy that spicer!",		"s_65c6992e":"Yes, I am ready.",		"s_658107f":"I can see you're busy.  Come talk to me when you've got some time.  I can always use your services.",		"s_622194e2":"I know that's not the most glamorous assignment, but when duty calls, we've got to answer.  Am I right?  Or am I right?",		"s_61189bfc":"One work-order for the maintenance crew lists the problem as 'Something in cockpit is loose'.  Guess what the maintenance workers wrote as the solution?",		"s_60fbb41a":"I like you.  You remind me of when I was young and stupid.  Listen up, you'd better start taking this job seriously!  We need those orders.  Go get them.  Now!",		"s_5fa9a5d3":"Thanks",		"s_5f5f76b5":"We're fighting the Rebel Alliance now?",		"s_5e86fa24":"Well, soldier, how did things go?",		"s_5d3166b9":"Everything is fine here. Nothing wrong at all.",		"s_5d262b71":"You are here for work now, yes?",		"s_5b5ed110":"Pilot error",		"s_5b1bed8b":"Well?",		"s_584a90f8":"You've done an excellent job for me, %NU.  I can see that you are ready for more training.  What are you interested in learning?",		"s_5715d65c":"Lots.  What do you WANT to do?",		"s_56e162f2":"Escort Duty",		"s_546d249e":"You're a cold woman, %NU.  Come see me when you're ready for your next assignment.",		"s_53de9d8f":"Like what?",		"s_53b9240e":"Ha ha!  Ok, enough goofing off.  I better get back to work.  Enjoy your visit to Corellia.",		"s_530a5a44":"Are you insane?  The weather there is terrible, the food tastes awful and the locals are all rude.  Talus is practically a backwater compared to Corellia.",		"s_529c014":"You're a cold man, %TU.  Come see me when you're ready for your next assignment.",		"s_52467dab":"I'll destroy them",		"s_523e23b2":"Here I am!",		"s_51b81b00":"They were too strong for me",		"s_513aa336":"No I'm not.  And they get worse!  This one says 'Problem:  Boosters not operational.' and then 'Solution:  Boosters will not work in OFF mode.'",		"s_501489d2":"All according to plan",		"s_4e94fa0f":"Try again?",		"s_4e6f47aa":"Oh.  Ok... heh, guess I'm getting to be old, telling the same old jokes over and over.",		"s_4e3437a8":"Oh, YOU'RE busy.  You think I don't work here?  Come talk to me when you're ready for an assignment.",		"s_485284b6":"I'll try again",		"s_47fde4be":"The Imperial just shrugs and says, 'Oh really, I didn't know that.'  So the Corellian goes back to his buddies and tells them, 'I insulted Darth Vader and he didn't even care'.",		"s_46cf37e9":"The Imperial just shrugged and said, 'Yeah, that's what your buddies were trying to tell me.'",		"s_457a7010":"No",		"s_44bc6772":"Fantastic.  Don't forget:  If the enemy is within range, so are you.",		"s_447b4291":"%TU!  Long time no see.  I've heard Commander Ramna was quite pleased with your performance.",		"s_41e79b8c":"Woah!  Woah!  Woah!  Slow down, there!  I was just kidding around with you.  Take it easy!",		"s_4165de51":"Good choice.  Now I have a special assignment for you!  Go to Dantooine Space and destroy a Hutt Transport.  The Hutts are making a large spice shipment through that system and we do not intend to let it reach its destination, which could very well be Corellia.",		"s_40e66be3":"I'll try",		"s_3e869ab":"Good!  How about NOW?  Is NOW good for you?",		"s_3cfd3bb4":"You'd BETTER stop mocking me",		"s_3b83352c":"On my way",		"s_3b2fdc7f":"Will do!  Thanks!",		"s_3a126327":"No plan survives initial contact with the enemy!  But I take it you were successful anyway.  I'll credit your bank for services rendered.",		"s_39bc34a9":"Hey, %NU, did I tell you about the maintenance report I just received?",		"s_3880d2bf":"I need a hyperdrive",		"s_370822d1":"Yes",		"s_36f60ccb":"That's what we want to know... Just what is he shipping around, and who is he doing it for... and that's what you're going to find out!",		"s_36961caf":"Wrong answer, %NU.  But I'll give you a hint, it involves you, Dantooine, a spice runner, and a successful mission.",		"s_346ddf":"You know Corellia's officially neutral in the civil war, right?  Well the Imperials seem to have a hard time remembering that.  Go out there and 'remind' them they aren't welcome as a military power in the Corellia system.",		"s_334bc":"Hey now!  Are you threatening me?  I'll have you know this old slice hound still has a bite.",		"s_32e9d36a":"Can't it wait?",		"s_322b6b69":"No, what about it?",		"s_32103432":"I have a special assignment for you.  Fly to Lok and inspect a Nym Cannon Ship for Shipment Orders.",		"s_315cee58":"Of course I'm right!  Now don't you hesitate to see me again the very moment you're available for duty.",		"s_30350c6":"I've heard it.",		"s_2ef8d174":"Look, the key to success is to shoot the enemy before the enemy shoots you.  Now get back to Dantooine and kill that spicer!",		"s_2d247e7b":"Ha ha!  Ok, I made that last one up...  But there is SOME kind of comedian working in the maintenance hangar!",		"s_2b10fbeb":"Good choice.  Your new abilities will come in handy for this next assignment.  Go escort a freighter through Yavin Space against Rebel aggressions.",		"s_28ea80d":"Recovery Duty",		"s_285c3698":"I do have some elective duty missions, actually. They're not the most exciting work, but they do need to be done. Take a look and tell me what you want to do.",		"s_26de1778":"You don't believe me?",		"s_264b3207":"You said it!",		"s_225d3518":"What are you waiting for?",		"s_1f3b7ea2":"Git!",		"s_1e666f74":"Equipment malfunction",		"s_1d843b61":"You're much too good a pilot to waste on the trivial tasks that I could assign you.  We need you in Lok.  Now!",		"s_1c8bddbb":"What is it?",		"s_1c81fc8b":"Or how about this:  It says 'Problem:  Hyperdrive volume is unbelievably loud'.... 'Solution:  Hyperdrive volume adjusted to more believable level.'",		"s_1c0972b6":"Did you get the shipment orders?",		"s_19104bb":"I don't have all the details.  Suffice to say that sometimes CorSec needs to be a little more proactive.  We can't always wait for trouble to come to us.",		"s_18206937":"I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.  Not get back to Yavin and complete your mission!",		"s_178d46a1":"Good.  Choose an assignment.",		"s_169df3bb":"Never mind.",		"s_163ba63a":"You've earned it!  Now go out on the town and catch yourself some rest and relaxation.  You look terrible!",		"s_158b60f":"Just fine",		"s_158a5883":"I don't believe you",		"s_13b10809":"Travel to Lok Space and protect a transport that has gotten between some Imperial and Rebels.",		"s_12da4881":"Yeah, well, they can't all be gems.  Anyway I'd better get back to work.  Take care, %NU.",		"s_106e3dbb":"I know you will.  Report back when you're done.  When you're SUCCESSFUL this time.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (corellia_privateer_trainer_2.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
