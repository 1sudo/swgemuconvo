Thanks again for the help killing those furballs.",	"s_489":"It looks like we are in the clear now. You have really proven yourself against those furballs today. We will clean ourselves up and then get out of here. I am not sure if Ssiksik promised you anything but without your help we probably all would be dead. Take this with my thanks.",	"s_491":"We are not out of the woods yet. Keep alert.",	"s_493":"You nearly got yourself killed walking in here like that! How did you get by all those furballs that have us surrounded? No matter...you are here now and I doubt you are going to be able to make it out again. Stay low and out of the way.",	"s_495":"Ssiksik sent me to offer you support.",	"s_497":"So Ssiksik got my last message. I was worried that the Wookiees had blocked the signal. Well I hope your ready for a fight. Those furballs hit us from all sides and took out half my crew in the first wave. We managed to fight them off...they do not have the courage to fight us straight up so they have been using hit and run tactics since in order to whittle our numbers down.",	"s_499":"How many Wookiees are out there?",	"s_501":"I am not really certain. I get the feeling that they have not yet been willing to commit their entire force to attacking us yet. We haven't been hit in a while so I am guessing that they will be attacking us any time now.",	"s_503":"Not now...I don't have time to deal with the likes of you. Beat it, pal."
