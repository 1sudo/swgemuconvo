Only some Gundark thugs. Apparently, Ponda hired those Gundark thugs as protection and was spooked when you defeated them.",	"s_15":"So what now?",	"s_17":"I suppose that will have to be enough.",	"s_18":"Unfortunately, sometimes that's the way it is. You did good work, though. I'm proud to have worked with you.",	"s_19":"You wouldn't happen to have any more work, would you?",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"We know that the Gundark gangs are working with Ponda Baba, so we'll turn our attention to them. They will tell us what we want to know one way or another.",	"s_21":"I don't but you might try heading back to Corellia. Word is that some reporter is investigating the Meatlumps and is looking for someone to do her heavy lifting.",	"s_22":"I have nothing more right now...sorry.",	"s_24":"Someone out there in the criminal undertow knows where we can find Ponda Baba. We just need to convince them to share that information with us.",	"s_26":"This Ponda Baba must be our guy. According to RSF records, he's a small-time thug who usually works out of the Tatooine system. Looks like he lost an arm in an altercation in Mos Eisley which is probably why he's after cybernetics. Your next move will be to track him down.",	"s_28":"How do I do that?",	"s_30":" A Neo-Cobral gang operating near Narmle is in tune with most of the underworld action happening in the area. Go convince them to reveal anything they might know about how to find Ponda Baba.",	"s_32":"Investigate one of the cybernetic labs and look for anything that might help identify the perpetrator. I've uploaded the location of the most recent break-in to you're datapad.",	"s_34":"So, instead of offering direct assistance, the Narmle Militia sends you. Typical. So be it. This is the situation: some small cybernetic labs in the area have recently been the victims of several break-ins. Nothing physical has been taken, but the lab techs fear that their research has been compromised.",	"s_36":"How do I fit into this?",	"s_38":"You are my investigation team. Which means it's you and me on this. I need you to help me track down whoever is doing this and apprehend them. You'll start by investigating one of the cybernetic labs and looking for anything that might help identify the perpetrator.",	"s_4":"Ponda Baba escaped, but word is that he has left the planet. I will be releasing his name and a holographic image to all security forces in the Naboo System. He will not be able to return to Rori or anywhere else in this part of the galaxy any time soon. For now, I will consider the case closed.",	"s_41":"I'll get started right away.",	"s_42":"I'll upload the location of the most recent break-in to you.",	"s_44":"At first I didn't mind being stationed on Rori, but the Narmle Militia really does not appreciate the RSF being active in these parts. Not until something goes wrong that they don't want to deal with."
