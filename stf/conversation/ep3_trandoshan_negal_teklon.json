Now beat it before you draw the attention of a katarn or something.",	"s_1169":"Hey...the autumn moon shines brightest on the sea shore.",	"s_1171":"Thanks for that helpful tidbit.",	"s_1173":"Blast it...that isn't the correct code phrase. Think Negal...think. Come on...think faster. Oh, I am just enjoying a nice stroll. Fresh air...beautiful trees.",	"s_1175":"Yeah...strolling along the Rryatt Trail. Good plan.",	"s_1177":"Wait, are you here from Borantok? I told him to use the special code phrase. Dumb Trandoshan, he is way too trusting...you could be anyone and how would I know?",	"s_1179":"Yeah, I could just be some guy taking two Rodian corpses for a walk.",	"s_1181":"Exactly! Well, it is too late now. Let's get rid of these things. The wild life around here will make pretty quick work of these two... Why does this one look like all flat?",	"s_1183":"Don't ask questions. Just dump the bodies.",	"s_1185":"Yeah, right. Okay, I will take care of these. You had better get out of here just in case you were followed. We cannot be too careful.",	"s_1187":"Ok, let's get on with this...wait a minute, I was told there would be two corpses! I don't see two corpses here. No way...I am out of this. Unless you bring me two corpses I am not doing anything. Nope...no...not going to do it.",	"s_1189":"Stop distracting me! It is hard enough to stay alive down here but if you lose focus...BAM...a whole bucket load of death will hit you."
