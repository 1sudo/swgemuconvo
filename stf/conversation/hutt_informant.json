It was all I had on me. Go sell it or something. You didn't deserve that great of a reward. It's been a pleasure doing business with you. Good day.",	"s_54b54bd0":"Here take it. Give me my payment.",	"s_70142360":"Why wouldn't I? It contains pertinent information regarding a highly-regarded politician and I'm one of Jabba's informants. Again, I ask... why wouldn't I want it?",	"s_7b45b993":"Get lost. I have no business to conduct with you. Too many people in arms about the Sand People attacking Bestine. It'll be easy for me, I can just leave just as easily as I've come. Go away. I have things to do, people to bribe.",	"s_dfffcfb":"Why do the dirty work of a politician when I can do it for you? Let me take that disk off your hands. In fact, I know I may have something with which I can pay you for your... generosity.",	"s_eed9dce1":"You're a fool. Get out of my sight.",	"s_f660c800":"What mess?",	"s_fb7697b2":"I can take care of this... mess for you."
