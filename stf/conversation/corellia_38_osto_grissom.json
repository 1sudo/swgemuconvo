What did I tell you? Those Meatlumps are crazy.",	"s_2":"",	"s_32":"Any luck finding out what those Meatlumps are up to?",	"s_34":"Hello. Can I help you? I'm waiting for someone from CorSec, so I can't really talk long.",	"s_36":"I was sent by CorSec. Can you tell me who assaulted you?",	"s_38":"Yes, I can. It was some Meatlumps. They came around the corner and simply attacked. I offered to give them some credits, but they ignored me. Luckily, a large group came out of the cantina, and the Meatlumps ran off when they saw them. Might have saved my life.",	"s_43":"This city used to be a safe place. You could walk down the streets without being attacked. But apparently that is no longer the case.",	"s_44":"Do you know why they attacked you?",	"s_45":"No, I have no idea. They didn't want money, so I don't think it was a robbery. Those Meatlumps are weird as it is, so there's no predicting what they might do."
