I've never had a Naboo ale that even comes close.",	"s_21":"Some Gungans called the Muskeg were asking about Hunnos?",	"s_22":"Yes, that's right. What of it? Look, I just got some Corellian ale. Would you mind letting me drink in peace?",	"s_43":"What a view. I love it here. I need a drink.",	"s_56":"Ah, Corellian ale. How wonderful. What brought this on?",	"s_58":"Oh, nothing. Just wanted to talk.",	"s_59":"Oh, great. More people wanting to talk. Just like those Gungans that came by not long ago. The Muskeg, I think they called themselves. Came by asking about my son Hunnos just before he escaped. My lousy, good for nothing son, I mean. Escapes from the RSF and doesn't even bother to come see his father."
