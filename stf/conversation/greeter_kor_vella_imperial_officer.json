But not about this place. They are planning to strike. I know it. I can feel it. It might not even matter if you're part of the Empire or a member of the Rebel Alliance. They might strike you down all the same just to be safe.",	"s_50712538":"You might consider leaving this planet. That would be the safest course. Leave for more civilized systems like Naboo. Trust me on this. That's why I have a pilot with me at all times... I can be gone at the drop of a bantha hide.",	"s_71912ea1":"Paranoid a little?",	"s_95a23c53":"Stand further back when addressing me. I know what you people are up to. You'd like nothing better than to add an Imperial officer to the notches on your weapon, wouldn't you?",	"s_b4e0582a":"Okay, I'll watch my back.",	"s_e0de9210":"I was wondering if you could answer some questions about space flight?",	"s_fd1873c3":"What?!! And what's wrong with some good, healthy paranoia anyway? It's kept me alive this long. You should not be so quick to judge."
