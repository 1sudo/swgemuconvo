I hate 'em! Worse thing that ever happened to the universe. And did you know that there are people mass producing them! I could not believe it. When I found out, I knew that I had to take action. These crate makers must be stopped!!",	"s_15":"So you made the bombs?",	"s_17":"Yes, that's right. I used some crates and made them into bombs. People must learn to fear crates and thus banish them from existence!! Wait a second...you...you're an adventurer. You must think you can stop me, but it's too late! You'll never find my bombs in time!",	"s_18":"Who are you?",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"I was once an accomplished adventurer. I scoured the galaxy looking for fame and fortune. But it all came crashing down.",	"s_21":"Actually, I already found and disarmed them.",	"s_22":"What happened?",	"s_24":"I was looking for a fabled artifact. The Force crystal of Naga Sadow or the Journals of Ood Bnar or maybe just a really well-made bantha burger. I forget what it was. But after searching crate after crate after crate for hours and days and weeks, I found nothing. Nothing!! I finally gave up and retired.",	"s_25":"What!??! Noooooo!",	"s_26":"Sounds like you don't like crates much...",	"s_28":"Lousy, manipulative crates!",	"s_4":"What do you want?"
