She merely needs someone who listens well and knows when to keep their mouth shut. Can you do that?",	"s_12":"I would be happy to help.",	"s_13":"No thanks. I do not like spying on others.",	"s_14":"You just don't understand how to run a space station. On your way. I'm busy.",	"s_15":"Very good, indeed! Mistress Inaldra needs you to to go to the Cantina and perform there. Once there, just listen. You will know when you find something really juicy for her.",	"s_16":"I'll do it!",	"s_17":"No way. I can't do something so intrusive.",	"s_18":"Have you completed your assignment?",	"s_19":"Yes. I overheard who owns this station.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"I am not done yet.",	"s_21":"Really?  I think you should talk with Mistress Inaldra herself. You know where she is.",	"s_22":"I will wait here.",	"s_23":"Thank you for your help. Please excuse me, but I am very busy.",	"s_3":"I hope you can help me.",	"s_4":"What do you need done?",	"s_5":"Of course I will help you.",	"s_6":"I can't right now, I'm busy.",	"s_7":"Oh dear. I hope someone else will help me.",	"s_9":"I suppose it is little suprise that Mistress Inaldra likes to keep tabs on the station, and what the rumors are. Her last informant had to leave the station suddenly. She needs someone to listen for rumors. If it's an important rumor, she will need to know the identity of the person spreading the particular rumor."
