Report!",	"s_4c76a3f0":"I'm sorry, but I cannot help you. There is no civilian business aboard the space station. I'd advise you to leave, my friend.",	"s_578cba1":"This is wartime, Pilot.

I'm just nervous.",	"s_9177e268":"I advise you to make it fast, Pilot. The war waits for no one.",	"s_919e66c4":"I see. What sort of ship do you think you'll need, then?",	"s_9e3acb05":"Outstanding, Pilot!
