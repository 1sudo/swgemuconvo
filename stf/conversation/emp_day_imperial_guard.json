You aren't authorized to be here. I can't allow you access to the prisoner.",	"s_496":"Nice job. We'll go over the cell's holos and forward that intel to the higher-ups. You might already have one of these banners, but have another for your excellent work on Empire Day.",	"s_498":"I was watching on the monitors. He's a tough one. Anyway, I think it's best you leave before Vader returns.",	"s_500":"Halt! Identify yourself.",	"s_502":"The Commander said I could take a look at the prisoner.",	"s_504":"Let's see...yes, you were added to the entry list. Better look now. I don't think that Jedi will last another session with Vader.",	"s_506":"Thanks for your help with interrogating the prisoner. There's not much more you can do at this point, leave the rest to Vader.",	"s_508":"I cannot allow anyone access without authorization from the Outpost Commander. "
