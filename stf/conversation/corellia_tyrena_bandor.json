What did she say?",	"s_18":"I haven't talked to her.",	"s_19":"Why not? Oh, I get it. She scares you too.",	"s_2":"",	"s_22":"So Faye finally found someone meaner than her?",	"s_23":"More deadly for certain.",	"s_24":"Well, I suppose I owe you. I just have to tell you, this isn't the end. It's just the tip of the asteroid. There is something big going on here. After I tell you where Kyran is, you'll be in it deep.",	"s_25":"I'm fine with that. Just tell me where this guy is.",	"s_26":"He's here, just outside of town at a makeshift camp  he set up, along with a lot of others.",	"s_27":"What others?",	"s_28":"You'll see.",	"s_29":"I told you what you wanted to know. I don't want to know anything else. Leave me out of it.",	"s_30":"Yea? What do you want?",	"s_32":"I am looking for a man named Kyran.

I just can't tell you where he is. If I told you, I'd have a death mark put on my head real quick like.",	"s_44":"Who would put a mark on you for this? Maybe I can convince them that this would be a bad idea.",	"s_46":"Yea, maybe. I'll tell you where the person who put the mark on me is, but don't mention me to her.",	"s_48":"Sure. Whatever you say.",	"s_50":"Ok, her name is Faye, Faye Patrick. She looks sweet but she'll cut you up before you get done saying hello.",	"s_52":"Where is...she?",	"s_54":"You can find her here.",	"s_56":"Buzz off."
