Neeka, right. That's who I am looking for.",	"s_13":"Please find her!",	"s_14":"I can't believe you found her. You are always going to be remembered. You have done us a great service.",	"s_15":"Sure. Glad to help.",	"s_16":"Maybe you can help me with the wife now? Eh, nevermind.",	"s_17":"I saw you talking to Kyran. He's a good guy. If he trusts you, then I guess I can too.",	"s_19":"He told me about some slavers near here. I am going to check it out.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"You are? Please could look for my daughter? Her name is Neeka. I am sure she is very scared there all alone.",	"s_23":"You escaped without your child?",	"s_25":"I know. I know! I didn't mean to. I thought my wife had her, and she thought I had her. Please you must find her. I don't think I can live knowing what I did. See if you can find Gordo Zek in the slave pens. He always knew what was going on.",	"s_27":"I will look for her.",	"s_29":"Oh, thank you!",	"s_31":"Thank you so much for rescuing Neeka. We'll never forget you.",	"s_32":"I'm sorry friend, but I just don't know you well enough to trust you. Maybe you should talk to Kyran."
