We can't stay here and wait it out.",	"s_15":"There is a small camp of survivors near the entrance.",	"s_17":"We'll have to make a run for it then. Cover us if you can. You've done so much for us already, %TU, but I really do not want to become one of them.",	"s_19":"I'll do my best, run for the starport area.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"Will do. Open the hatch when you are ready.",	"s_23":"Let us know when you are ready.",	"s_25":"Look like you dozed off for a few minutes. You must be exhausted. Ready to get out of here?",	"s_26":"Are you stuck down here too?",	"s_5":"It is finally good to see you in person, and in one piece. My name is Doctor Nomi Rhane, good to meet you, %TU.",	"s_7":"Lets get out of here Doctor.",	"s_9":"We'll follow your lead.
