Did you get manage to help out Jornel Savas?",	"s_2":"",	"s_254":"That's all we have for you right now. You've been a huge help. If you are looking for more work however, I might be able to help you out.",	"s_256":"No thanks, I think I need a vacation!",	"s_258":"That is understandable. Return to me if you change your mind.",	"s_260":"Well, I could use the work.",	"s_262":"An old friend of mine, Jornel Savas works with Corsec on Corellia. He recently contacted me. It seems they've encountered some trouble and he's looking for capable individuals to help solve whatever the problem is.",	"s_264":"Maybe I'll give this one a miss.",	"s_266":"Very well, let me know if you change your mind.",	"s_268":"Sure, I'll look up Jornel Savas.",	"s_270":"Great, I'll let him know that you are coming.",	"s_272":"Fantastic job! You've really come through for us all on this one.",	"s_274":"What about those escaped Genetech Syndicate scientists?",	"s_276":"We've filed a complaint with the Imperial Research Division for carrying out class 5 biological experiments on an inhabited world, but I think it's going to be a long time before we see anything come of that.",	"s_278":"So they just get away?",	"s_280":"Nothing we can do right now, %TU. Look, I'm just glad we're not bug food!",	"s_282":"I suppose so.",	"s_284":"Anyway...here's your reward. I pressured the Talus government to include a bonus for you. This is as much as a year's salary for some officers, but you earned it.",	"s_286":"Sorry about that. The communications array must have gone down again. Let me see your comm, I will retune it to the new frequency for you.",	"s_288":"Here you go.",	"s_290":"There we go...try it out, see if you can get the mission information.",	"s_292":"Yes, that's better. Let's recalibrate the mission information.",	"s_294":"Ok, what information do you want to check?",	"s_296":"Let's check the information on destroying the eggs.",	"s_298":"Performing calibration...now.",	"s_300":"Got it.",	"s_302":"Anything else?",	"s_304":"Let's check the information on destroying the research data.",	"s_306":"Starting calibration...now.",	"s_308":"That checks out.",	"s_310":"Is that all?",	"s_312":"Let's check the information on destroying the creatures.",	"s_314":"Beginning calibration...now.",	"s_316":"That's confirmed.",	"s_318":"Has that got it?",	"s_320":"I'm good.",	"s_322":"Great. Get back to the bunker and let me know whats going on there.",	"s_324":"You should be investigating the Genetech Syndicate lab. We need to know if that is the location of the brood queen.",	"s_326":"You need to find that queen. Please go check out this location!",	"s_328":"Where do you need me to go?",	"s_330":"Here is the information.",	"s_332":"This is dire news indeed. We traced the flight trajectory of the crashed ship, and it appears it took off from Dearic. A corsec scout team found a lab owned by the Genetech Syndicate undergoing an emergency evacuation. This is a good place to check for the queen arachne. Find out if it's the correct lab and then send me a comm.",	"s_334":"Understood.",	"s_336":"Here's your payment for the rescue operation. There will be more when you've killed the queen.",	"s_338":"Thank you.",	"s_340":"Be careful. These things seem to be designed to kill everything they come in contact with.",	"s_342":"What are you doing here? We need you out there looking for those crash victims!",	"s_344":"Sorry, I am on my way.",	"s_346":"Let's hope you can find them. This is turning into a very strange rescue operation.",	"s_348":"Please go check out the crash site. People's lives are depending on you.",	"s_350":"I'm going there now.",	"s_352":"Thank you.",	"s_354":"Glad to have you back, %TU. We've picked up an explosion  in the mountains to the northeast of here. Starport sensors showed a starship on that trajectory. We believe the explosion was it crashing into the mountains. We need you to go check it out.",	"s_356":"Any other information?",	"s_358":"We don't have any rescue teams available at the moment. When you find the crash site send me a comm with the location, and we'll get one out to you as soon as possible.",	"s_360":"Excellent work on the Selonian situation. I've been asked to direct you to the capital building in Dearic. There, you will need to speak to officer Loessin. Good luck, and thanks again for your help.",	"s_362":"You should not be reporting back to me. You must complete the tasks the Selonians have asked of you.",	"s_364":"Vitala Baize said you could help out. Let me detail the situation. There is a den of Selonians just outside Nashal that are being exploited by a group of smugglers. It appears the smugglers have some of the den's people, and are using them to coerce the rest of the den into mining for them. I need you to talk to Kiki Dorente and see if you can help her with the den's problems.",	"s_366":"Why can't you do this?",	"s_368":"Selonians are a proud race. They do not ask for help lightly. I suspect it took quite a bit to get Kiki to come to the conclusion the den needed outside help. In any event, it certainly cannot come from a political organization like CorSec. We want to help, but they would never allow us to help them. That's where an independent agent such as yourself comes in.",	"s_370":"So I should just go talk to Kiki about what she needs me to do?",	"s_372":"Correct. Do not mention any ties to CorSec. They will not react well to that information. You need to understand that they do not welcome outside help easily.  You're likely to meet unfriendly Selonians during your tasks. Do not let them affect the completion of your tasks. Selonians are a very unemotional race, it may seem that they are ungrateful, but the truth is they will be deeply indebted to you.",	"s_374":"I will keep that in mind.",	"s_376":"Please do, and good luck. What you do here will have a tremendous impact on Selonian - Human relations here in the core cluster.",	"s_378":"Sorry citizen, I do not have time to talk right now."
