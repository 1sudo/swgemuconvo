		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (fs_gadget_specialist.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor.",	"s_0":"",	"s_1283cb1c":"That's quite alright. Good day to you.",	"s_3d8991fc":"I... um... see. Well. Good day then.",	"s_40":"Lt. Jasper sent me to get your help with this device.",	"s_41":"Lt. Jasper? Ah yes, I remember him. Is he still with CorSec? I seem to remember he had quite a lot of skill with his hands. Woodcarving, I believe it was. Maybe stone sculpting. Something like that. Well, let me take a look at that device.",	"s_42":"What do you think it does?",	"s_43":"Looks pretty straightforward. It's used as a relay from data transfer or communication. You connect this to a terminal. After that, you can send messages from a remote location, but they will appear to come from the terminal to which this device is attached. Could be very useful. Could also be very malicious. If you give me some time, I could rig it to spit out the global coordinates of the source of any signal sent for it to relay.",	"s_4389624e":"Aurilia on Dathomir... yeah, I know the place. Well, know of it anyway. I've done business with them in the past. They need a replacement computer core?",	"s_44":"That sounds great. Lt. Jasper would want that.",	"s_45":"Yes, he probably would. While I'm working on this, how about you do me a favor? There's a local businessman who owes me some money for services I performed for him a while back. He refuses to pay. Could you go talk to him and collect my payment from him?",	"s_46":"I'd be happy to help.",	"s_46bdeee4":"Sounds like a terrible idea. Thanks for nothing.",	"s_47":"Maybe later. I can't right now.",	"s_48":"Thank you. His name's Frye Troeman. He's not pleasant.",	"s_49":"Ah, I see how it is. That reminds me. I have about a dozen other jobs that are in line ahead of yours. Come back for the device in about, say, a month or so?",	"s_4bcdc402":"You need to collect or craft all of the required components and place them in the kit. Once you have all of the components, the kit's automated system will build the tracking device.",	"s_4d7434d2":"That's disappointing. But I guess if you don't have one, then you don't have one.",	"s_50":"I have your money from Mr. Troeman.",	"s_51":"Excellent. I'm so glad that's behind me. No more doing business on credit, that's my new motto. Here's the remote relay device. Bring it to Lt. Jasper. Next time it's used, it should give you the global position of the source signal.",	"s_533919fc":"Tell the Aurilia engineer that I wish I could have been more helpful, but not much I can really do about something like that.",	"s_55082d0b":"Er... no one. I'm sorry to have bothered you.",	"s_5542b04b":"Oh, my apologies. I'll let you get back to work.",	"s_5a562246":"I've much to do...  can I help you?",	"s_65f76975":"Go to any ticket droid at a starport. They have access to the database with information about fallen and abandoned satellites around the galaxy. You can purchase the rights to one of them from the droid.",	"s_6d9d310":"Ha. I was just offering to help. You can't expect me to ignore my livelihood and give this kind of thing away for nothing. My price is more than fair. But whatever. Good day.",	"s_70253663":"The chief engineer at Aurilia can probably give you more information, but I believe you'll have to modify the core's current interface so that it will be compatible with the village's computer. Usually there's a simple menu on the core itself that will allow you to try and modify it.",	"s_7045a2d7":"Welcome back. Still interested in a downed satellite tracking device? The price is 530 credits.",	"s_79fe19ed":"Yes, I was told you could help me obtain a replacement computer core.",	"s_7f396fce":"How do I use this tracking device?",	"s_85bd3ae2":"The chief engineer from a village on Dathomir. The village of Aurilia.",	"s_8fe6a678":"You must think I just fell off of a bantha! I'll not be scammed so easily.",	"s_9d19b512":"Ha. Whatever. Be on your way, then.",	"s_a1dd9b9e":"That's correct. Their current one was damaged during an attack on the village.",	"s_a8749106":"Sounds fair enough. I'll take one.",	"s_b49f7181":"A replacement computer core? Who gave you that idea?",	"s_b518079a":"You don't seem to have enough funds at the moment. I'd love to help, but I can't give the kit away for nothing. Come back when you have more funds.",	"s_b867b2e4":"How do I make this computer core work with the village computer?",	"s_b9f237f":"Sounds reasonable. I'm off to the starport.",	"s_bab2829b":"How do I get tracking data for a fallen satellite?",	"s_bdcd33ef":"Excellent. I'll just place it in your inventory. Good luck finding a satellite and that replacement computer core.",	"s_bdedc5e2":"Wait! Before speaking with the droid, there's one other thing. You'll need a downed satellite tracking device. When you purchase the rights to one, the droid will upload tracking data to your tracking device. It will then help you to locate the fallen satellite. I can provide you with a kit for just such a device for a small fee. Say, 530 credits? ",	"s_be1b8c5a":"Is there nothing that can be done to find a replacement for Aurilia?",	"s_be68030a":"Well, I wish I could help, but I don't have anything like that in stock. Rarely do to be honest. I tend to tinker more with smaller devices. Large systems like a town... or village... computer require far more attention than I'm willing to give.",	"s_c7baf80c":"What do I do with this tracking device kit?",	"s_d8a8c77e":"Now you can bring it to Aurilia's chief engineer and then bask in the glory of a job well done.",	"s_e5c058a8":"Hmm... let me think a minute.  You know, there might just be something I can help you with after all. Most satellites have a central computer that is heavily shielded to withstand the extreme nature of their orbit. Once a satellite falls from orbit and is abandoned, anyone can purchase the rights to them. I've done so myself on various occasions.",	"s_e79d337":"Nothing's easier. you simply go to any starport and speak with the ticket droid. These droids have access to a galactic-wide database that maintains records about satellites in orbit around most known planets. For a fee, you can purchase the rights to one that has fallen and gone unclaimed.",	"s_f9732f00":"Simply use the device's menu and choose to activate the tracking device. If you're on the wrong planet, it will tell you which planet the satellite is on. Once you're on the correct planet, the device can then pinpoint the exact location of the satellite.",	"s_faaeb65f":"You don't have enough space in your inventory for the kit. Make some room and then come speak with me again.",	"s_fe739220":"The computer core is ready... now what?",	"s_fff0f4f2":"How do I purchase the rights to a fallen and abandoned satellite?"
