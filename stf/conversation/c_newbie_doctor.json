I will get another one.  I suppose it seems strange that I would call on a stranger and then not be upset if that same stranger lost something of mine.",	"s_314":"Please take care of yourself.",	"s_407":"",	"s_409":"Thank you for coming to see me, %TU.",	"s_411":"You're welcome.  I have this viewscreen reader for you. ",	"s_413":"Yes, thank you.  I suppose you want to know why I asked to see you.",	"s_415":"The thought did cross my mind.",	"s_417":"I wish to explain about damage.  I assume that you already know that you can heal your damage with a bacta shot.  You may also use stimpacks for a quick shot of healing, even without medical training.  Allow me to supply you with a stimpack to help you along the way until you buy or make your own. ",	"s_419":"Thanks!",	"s_421":"Lastly, I want to talk to you about wounds. More serious damage can result in wounds.  Only time in a medical center or a doctor can remedy that.  A few wounds will not seriously impair your ability to function, but a great number of them will.  Before you go out to hunt, get familiar with how to heal yourself.",	"s_423":"Normally, yes, but now I'm coming to expect it."
