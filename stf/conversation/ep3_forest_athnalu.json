I am free. Thank you. Thank you for saving me.",	"s_4178":"Do you.. [Athnalu looks up at you.] Do you have the things that will fix me... the things that will free me from this prison? Please.. Please tell me you do!",	"s_4180":"I do. Here they are. I hope they help.",	"s_4182":"[Athnalu gathers them quickly from you.] Stay here while I mix these...",	"s_4184":"[Athnalu stares off into the distance, humming a haunting tune. She doesn't sense your presence.]",	"s_4186":"[Athnalu looks at you blankly.] Like threaded knives, I can feel them scrape at my soul. They use little dolls to control me.. control my soul, my mind and fill it with little voices. Little dolls and little voices. Do the dolls speak to me? Will you help fix my soul? Will you?!",	"s_4188":"What will you have me do?",	"s_4190":"I need to wash my soul. And I need certain things to help me make the voices go away. I need snake eyes to find the illness in my mind, mouf hair to capture it so it can't get away and a Mysess Flower to make it all better again. Will you help me? Please... [Athnalu looks at you, pleading with her eyes.]",	"s_4192":"Yes, I will gather these things for you.",	"s_4194":"Find them. Help me take the voices away.",	"s_4196":"No, not right now.",	"s_4198":"[Athnalu dazes off and begins to mumble again.]",	"s_42":"I am not sure if these are the correct dolls. I will throw these away and collect different dolls.",	"s_4200":"Where are my dolls? Do you have them? Can I see them? [Athnalu looks at you curiously.]",	"s_4202":"Yes, I have them. Here.",	"s_4204":"Yes! [Athnalu holds the dolls close to her.] Now, I will find out how they control me. Maybe I can cure my illness. Maybe the voices will get out of my head. Is my soul lost? Will you help me fix it?",	"s_4206":"Yes, I will help you fix it. What do you need?",	"s_4208":"[Athnalu dazes off, mumbling to herself while holding the dolls close.]",	"s_4210":"I can't sense them.. I can't sense the Voodoo dolls on you. [Athnalu almost lunges at you.] Where are they?! I need them. Get back out there and find them! You said you'd help me! [Athnalu growls.]",	"s_4212":"Just.. calm down. I'm going out there to find them.",	"s_4214":"[Athnalu shrinks back.] Don't hurt me... just find them. Please. I need them. I need to get better.",	"s_4216":"Athnalu stares past you.] The Sayormi... they have.. touched my soul, a part of me that can never be restored. I can feel my soul rotting, falling away like summer to fall. [A single tear rolls down Athnalu's face.]",	"s_4218":"What.. is wrong with you? Who are you?",	"s_4220":"[Athnalu looks at you, as if she just noticed your presence.] Who are you? What do you want?! You can't hurt me! No one can!",	"s_4222":"Hurt you? I just want to help you?",	"s_4224":"I must understand why they wish to hurt me. I have to understand them. I have to... or my soul is lost. Will you help me? [Athnalu grabs your shoulders harshly.] Will you help me?!",	"s_4226":"Ow!--yes, I will help you. Just calm down.",	"s_4228":"Please.. before it's too late! I can feel their hands around my soul, squeezing tighter. All hope is lost to me. My mind aches.. [Athnalu holds her head.] Make the voices stop! Make them stop! [Athnalu stares at you, eyes wide.] Find the Sayormi! Bring me their voodoo dolls. It is how they're controlling me. Only then can I make them stop. My head hurts.. it hurts so badly.",	"s_4230":"Okay, okay. I'll be back soon.",	"s_4232":"I need 5 voodoo dolls. Such a tiny number. So small. Hurry back.. hurry back or they'll suffocate me! Please!! [Athnalu calls after you.]",	"s_4234":"I can't get into this. It's too weird for me.",	"s_4236":"[Athnalu just cries.]",	"s_4238":"[Athnalu stares at you.] Such a dear soul. So lost.. so lost..",	"s_4240":"[Athnalu just stares at you.] Who are you? What do you want? Are you here to hurt us? Go away! I can't speak with you. It's forbidden. [Athnalu hides her face in her hands.]",	"s_43":"Why do you tease me?"
