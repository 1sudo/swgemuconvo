It's probably best not to talk to me.  ",	"s_1578":"Why? You look sad.",	"s_1579":"Not sad, scared!  If you were in my position, you would be scared too!",	"s_1580":"Can I buy you a drink?",	"s_1581":"No thank you.  Please leave me alone.",	"s_1582":"That's terrible.  What is scaring you?",	"s_1583":"N...nothing.  Never mind.  Leave me alone!",	"s_1584":"Oh, it can't be that bad.",	"s_1585":"How would you know?!  You didn't upset a major crime boss!  ",	"s_1586":"Tell me what happened.",	"s_1587":"I shouldn't have told you even that much!  I guess at this point, if I'm dead, I'm dead.  Fine.

I need to be alone right now."
