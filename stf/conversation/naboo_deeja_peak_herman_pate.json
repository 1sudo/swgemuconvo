What ring?",	"s_15":"Good luck with those smugglers. You'll probably want to soften them up a bit first before going after Janelle.",	"s_18":"The ring he lost to you as a marker in a sabacc game?",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"Oh, right. That one. I, er, don't have it any more.",	"s_23":"Then where is it?",	"s_25":"I, er, kind of used it to pay off a debt. This was before Vance paid me, which I never really thought he would do. There were some spice smugglers I owed some money to. Janelle, their leader, seemed to really like the ring, and offered to overlook my late payments in exchange for the ring.",	"s_27":"So how do I get the ring back?",	"s_29":"I guess you'll have to go get it from the smugglers. They're called Mountaintop smugglers. Their leader is Janelle. You'll have to go fight them to get the ring back. And if you win, maybe I won't have to pay any of the rest of what I owe them.",	"s_31":"I see. I'll go fight the Mountaintop smugglers.",	"s_33":"Right. Good luck then.",	"s_43":"I want another drink, but I also need to pay off my debts. What do I do?",	"s_56":"Yeah? Can I help you with something?"
