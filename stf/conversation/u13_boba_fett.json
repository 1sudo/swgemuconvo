Taking a lot of jobs that involve getting your hands bloody. Or at least dirty. I'd like to know what the new talent is capable of handling...whether you're a bounty hunter or not.  After all, I may have to hunt you some day. So with that in mind,  I'm going to throw three bounties your way. I've already done the hard part and tracked them to this bunker. See if you can handle the rest.",	"s_4":"I can a handle it.",	"s_5":"Well, we'll see, won't we.",	"s_6":"I'm not interested. Go find some other test dummy.",	"s_7":"I see. You're either frightened or overconfident. Either way, you've already revealed much to me.",	"s_8":"What are you standing around for? We're not here for tea and crumpets. Go.",	"s_9":"Passable, I suppose. I'm underwhelmed mostly, but you did manage to complete my bounties. That's something."
