A hard blow against the Empire now would destroy morale.",	"s_8cfb34cb":"Just rumors.",	"s_8e632a96":"You're awfully paranoid.",	"s_8fbd3f85":"I don't think it's the prison that interests them.",	"s_90377ed4":"Affirmative!",	"s_90875aed":"What's going on here?",	"s_9173548c":"Right away.",	"s_92":"Where is he?",	"s_92bcea":"You're going to find out. I want you to track him down. Make sure he never gets that medal.",	"s_94":"At the moment, he is in Dathomir space on a Lambda shuttle, en route between the planet and an Imperial fleet... with an Imperial escort.",	"s_9401fd7b":"It's very difficult.",	"s_94a2001c":"He's a smuggler who works with Nym. You can find him in Lok. Meet with him there and bring his information back to the Rebel Commando team in the Dathomir system.",	"s_94ece311":"I think that's my line. And besides, you should know better than most people how important security is these days.",	"s_96":"What sort of security has he got?",	"s_966a1e03":"Information is more valuable than gold in wartime. And remember, I'm working for you.",	"s_98":"He's on board a Lambda shuttle. Do you know what that is?",	"s_9c7613eb":"Perhaps. ",	"s_9c91459e":"You should always keep your eyes and ears open.  But as of now, you're stationed at a Rebel outpost on the planet Rori. You'll report to General Ufwol.",	"s_9df42b04":"So are you. Please return to your ship.",	"s_9e4da02c":"And we're going  to free him.",	"s_9f86f530":"There is an Imperial defector in the Dathomir prison. We want to free him and find out what he knows. This smuggler I mentioned, he has been to the prison, he knows the layout.",	"s_9fb0046e":"He's good.",	"s_a0e63032":"That prison is impenetrable.",	"s_a30c8590":"Because we don't inspect our own ships.",	"s_a41a2281":"Hm. Rumors. Interesting. I wonder what people are saying.",	"s_a53ea74c":"Worthwhile things often are.",	"s_a68dfaa6":"Sure I have!",	"s_a8af09fc":"Why do you want me to meet him?",	"s_a8e0243a":"All Rebel ships are now subject to inspection. And YOU will inspect them.",	"s_a91e3c6b":"You sent for me?",	"s_a927c891":"What's next?",	"s_a9bcadc0":"I'd like to see YOUR dossier.",	"s_a9cddbcc":"I hit them hard with that last attack.",	"s_ab085367":"Those spies would have been no use to us dead. But you brought them back alive. Very useful. And that's why I've chosen you for this next mission.",	"s_ab1cce5f":"That thermal bomb would have ripped this place apart.",	"s_ae11747c":"Leave that to me. Are you ready for a dogfight?",	"s_aeb6556c":"You would be tremendously bored by it, I think.",	"s_b0da26cf":"I'm sure.",	"s_b136da95":"Then you know about the prison here. This planet is a backwater, a worthless hunk of rock. Yet for some reason, the Empire has taken an unusual interest in the area.",	"s_b1479cf9":"Now would be a good time.",	"s_b2aeeeda":"He's a pirate. Everything he does is illegal.",	"s_b3ae7d2":"Yes. Well, that brings me to my next mission. The Empire knows that we have this information, and I am sure they are planning attacks as we speak, to kill us before we can take action.",	"s_b3f5831e":"Ah, we do not know each other yet. Even if I knew, I would not tell you.",	"s_b40f340":"Not a chance.",	"s_b4a1239c":"Ugly word. I prefer 'information broker.'",	"s_b6da869b":"We are both serving the Rebellion. ",	"s_b7138aed":"I'm not following.",	"s_b7d2e561":"The information is frightening, but not specific. And for all we know, they're giving us disinformation. It will take us a while before we can be sure they are telling us the truth.",	"s_b84b366c":"How can I help?",	"s_b9f4f973":"I didn't know they were keeping a file on me.",	"s_be155900":"No, of course not.",	"s_be88a7d6":"Because he's been to prison.",	"s_be9caae0":"The Rebellion sent me your dossier.",	"s_bf9961a9":"Blah. Do you have work for me?",	"s_c2051287":"I think you ask a lot of questions.",	"s_c265503e":"He is? Why?",	"s_c2850e6":"Same difference.",	"s_c2efe3eb":"They're not just going to walk through the front door, either. I expect they'll try something more devious. According to our intel, they may try to smuggle explosives into this system on Rebel ships.",	"s_c3e376a5":"%TU!  Explain yourself!  What's this I've heard about you assisting the Empire?",	"s_c4bc453f":"Indeed. We've equipped your ship with a space assault droid. Disable his ship and shoot that droid onto its hull. The droid will breach the ship, subdue the crew and take control of the ship. Then we'll see what we've got.",	"s_c4dbdf08":"So now I have a dossier AND a reputation.",	"s_c4f6eef8":"It was?",	"s_c599f19a":"There's a prisoner there, an Imperial defector. He will be helpful to us - once he's free.",	"s_c6594c52":"Are you trying to anger me?",	"s_c65b834a":"Exactly. But we are going to start inspecting them, starting immediately. And YOU will inspect them.",	"s_c74a6348":"You must finish what you started.",	"s_c7aa6bdb":"The Bothan reputation precedes me.",	"s_c93b6a54":"That won't be necessary. ",	"s_c9ba6bc2":"Of course. ",	"s_ca2ba04f":"Speaking of Imperials, you did a very nice job out there with the Corellian Corvette. Thanks to you, we now have several Imperial spies in our custody. They are founts of information.",	"s_ca8f5dda":"When do I start?",	"s_cd86689a":"They're not going to walk through the front door and announce themselves, that's for sure. According to our intel, they're going to try and smuggle explosives into this system using Rebel ships.",	"s_d057d7d3":"That is the price of success. ",	"s_d1ec36f0":"Very good. We have been tracking the movements of an Imperial Security Officer. He has information we need. The time has come to capture him.",	"s_d258e826":"Do not underestimate your enemies. They are as dedicated to their cause as you are to yours.",	"s_d2d48b62":"You're very observant.",	"s_d2f7d204":"This is a prison planet. Worthless. And yet for some reason, the Empire has taken a keen interest in the area.",	"s_d31b92f9":"Perhaps you could introduce me to your friends. I am always interested in meeting new people.",	"s_d35a8803":"One of the Empire's best pilots is en route to a medal ceremony. He is the hope of the Empire.",	"s_d3e5c0aa":"Then how about another mission?",	"s_d454739a":"Soon.",	"s_d5bf212f":"The coordinates are in your database. Go now.",	"s_d6643019":"Actions speak louder than words.",	"s_d6963a70":"About the Dathomir system?",	"s_d70dba34":"Yes.",	"s_d72cbbfa":"You are now assigned to the Rebel outpost on Rori. You'll be reporting to General Ufwol.",	"s_d762182e":"The Empire's good too. And they want to put a stop to our activities, immediately if not sooner.",	"s_d85b3a9c":"What if I refuse to continue?",	"s_d9245236":"I don't think I know you. I'm certainly not expecting you.",	"s_d9a23c21":"Your attack on those Imperial ships was effective - perhaps too effective.",	"s_db13b2d9":"Immediately. Thank you again for all your hard work. And remember: watch your back.",	"s_db14e2c1":"We believe the Empire plans to return the favor.",	"s_db5f856c":"He's an Imperial defector. We plan to engineer an outbreak.",	"s_dc95008b":"We'll soon find out which one of you is the best. I want you to go after him.",	"s_de2df0e3":"Thanks - I think.",	"s_dfcc11ba":"Yes, about that assault. It was effective - perhaps too effective.",	"s_e19c193f":"That Imperial Security Officer has provided us with a tremendous amount of information. With it, we can launch attacks that will decimate the Imperial fleet's infrastructure.",	"s_e24417b":"He will help us to plan an attack on Dathomir prison.  ",	"s_e3c318b4":"Specifically the Dathomir prison.",	"s_e3d61563":"Bomb-making material, Imperial comlinks, schematics - anything suspicious.",	"s_e5235eff":"Do you have a mission for me?",	"s_e6631bf8":"What is my mission?",	"s_e68c0bb8":"Anyone who believes that is an idiot!",	"s_e95511fe":"Of course they are. ",	"s_eb3726f6":"Yes. You're going to help me get information - from an Imperial defector.",	"s_eba35f17":"When do I leave?",	"s_ec3a4b5b":"You're dealing with a patriot!",	"s_ec44bbf0":"We are interested in an Imperial Security Officer. He has information we need.",	"s_ecb17e60":"I don't know what you mean",	"s_ed4e5e50":"Sure was. Do you have my next mission?",	"s_f6cd86be":"Why was he in prison?",	"s_f72b6d44":"Would you like to learn a new skill now?",	"s_f8b02865":"What do I do?",	"s_f9044504":"There's more I could teach you.",	"s_f9e6ef1b":"I do. There's a prisoner on Dathomir we wish to meet.",	"s_f9f2fe5c":"I like to know who I'm dealing with.",	"s_fa38c858":"I thought I was working for you.",	"s_fa6e2383":"Looks like our information was correct. Thank you for your efforts. Are you ready for a new skill?",	"s_fab55d44":"I know a smuggler. He works with Nym. And now he's going to work with you.",	"s_fb871ded":"Central Command has issued new orders for you.",	"s_fd8741c0":"I'm not scared of things that go bump in the night.",	"s_ff50cabc":"All Bothans are spies.",	"s_ff8b2372":"Correct. They are fiercely guarding something there. Do you know anything about it?",	"s_fffe6e23":"You will be."
