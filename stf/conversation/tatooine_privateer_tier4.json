Prettiest corner of the galaxy. Although you won't be doing any business on the surface. This is strictly a space mission.",		"s_e9125b15":"But the question is, what have you done for me lately? So let's get to work. Had enough of this place?",		"s_e86f1062":"How do you know?",		"s_e79eddec":"Sounds like fun.",		"s_e775f9ef":"Anytime! I'm a generous Rodian.

Everybody's out there these days: CorSec, RSF, Imperial, even Valarian ships. Plenty of targets. So which one is it going to be? ",		"s_c870211d":"OK! That's all I need to hear. Now listen up! Here's the situation. One of Nym's ships is carrying a load of spice - although you didn't hear that from me.

Do you have any?",		"s_bdae1e2f":"Vessels! Done! Now then. You did good work with Jabba. ",		"s_bd9c8748":"She's definitely the UGLIEST - and that's saying something! Jabba's not exactly easy on the eyes. And forget about Lady Valarian becoming the top player. It'll never happen. ",		"s_bc331bd7":"Nothing to tell.

It's up to you, but I think it would be a smart move, %TU.",		"s_b16ff72d":"Lots of people in this system hate the Valarians. They appreciate what you did.

I've heard stories.",		"s_95b55346":"I just got a communique from Alliance headquarters. Admiral Burke is asking us for help. They're in a jam, and they are looking for the best pilots they can find.",		"s_94e9bd3b":"I don't want you to join ANYTHING.

",		"s_900f01d1":"What?",		"s_8ee47f8c":"Jabba's always working an angle. And we haven't heard much from him lately. Is he planning something in Dathomir?",		"s_8e76f5e4":"Sure.

Don't spend it all in one place.",		"s_87d7e908":"I know.",		"s_879f33d":"I'm assuming you have work for me.",		"s_8782c730":"You guessed right. Let's see what I've got on my roster! If you want to be a hero to Nym's group, you could rescue one of his transports. CorSec and RSF ships are attacking it as we speak!",		"s_877810f1":"Enlighten me.",		"s_87550112":"If you want to be a hero to Nym's group, you could rescue one of his transports.

",		"s_842279cd":"How about exotic vessels?",		"s_81f135c8":"Time for you to get to work! You're no use to me when you're just standing around. What are you going to do? Or do you need me to explain the situation to you again?",		"s_8138df62":"Jabba's a good ally for us. He's the strongest crime lord in the sector, by far.

We could always use something like that.",		"s_741df7ed":"Where?",		"s_73d0a21b":"What? No!",		"s_71d95498":"So you want me to join the Rebellion?",		"s_71d852f5":"How about droid intelligence theory?",		"s_717febcb":"Did you like the palace?",		"s_70a95d7f":"False modesty! I love it.

They're killers and sociopaths, but they're good earners. And they need our help.",		"s_6b1ef548":"I'm looking for Talon Karrde.",		"s_69647725":"Actually, no, you didn't. Talon said it! Maybe Talon was wrong!",		"s_694ce3f1":"Could you explain it to me again?.",		"s_67ec71d0":"Hey, there you are. Ready to get back to work?",		"s_67e6df55":"Okay.",		"s_677b3694":"EVERYBODY wants money!",		"s_6598178f":"Interesting.",		"s_658f174d":"What am I looking for?",		"s_636f3f4d":"Sure is! The Black Sun are killers and sociopaths, but they're good earners. And they need our help.",		"s_62b0748":"Everything's coming up roses, %TU.",		"s_616c8086":"If Jabba's happy, we're happy. We can't do our jobs without the love and affection of our local crime lords.",		"s_61657d0f":"I see.",		"s_5e6a9bde":"No, I'M telling YOU to mind your OWN business! And your business is at Jabba's Palace! So start walking, bub.",		"s_5c05ecff":"I just did what I was told.",		"s_5af217dd":"Thanks. I think so! You're clear to leave anytime.",		"s_59fffde8":"Sure! But the ship's almost completely disabled, so the guys on board are no use. And there aren't any other Black Sun in the vicinity. We're it! ",		"s_593a67cd":"Talon says you're a good worker. But I'll believe it when I see it! ",		"s_59209e57":"So put me to work! ",		"s_58b4c6a6":"The last thing you want is a bunch of fighter aces gunning for you. Get back out there!",		"s_5866c569":"I follow you.",		"s_58362a8d":"Tell me about it.",		"s_5681e74d":"He is one of the Alliance fleet commanders. He's got a force stationed in the Outer Rim. Not really sure what they are planning to do out there, but if he is looking for outside help, it must be something big.",		"s_559912":"Don't be so quick to judge me. I can get the job done.",		"s_55671c91":"Not really. It smelled terrible. ",		"s_555c668c":"I know all! Get your backside over to Jabba's Palace.",		"s_53de9d8f":"Like what?",		"s_5206ea9b":"Mind your own business.",		"s_50335ae8":"So tell me.

Pronto!",		"s_4854b859":"I thought you told me you were the greatest pilot of all time.",		"s_472841f4":"Freight plans. I want to know what they're transporting! ",		"s_4499bb6":"Valarians are becoming active around Dantooine. Too active, if you know what I mean. We need to nip that nonsense in the bud. I want you to disable a Valarian gunship and inspect it.",		"s_443da380":"Sure - for now. One of these days, Lady Valarian could become the strongest.",		"s_412dc22e":"I'll take that escort.",		"s_3ff5bba1":"I said that? ",		"s_3fac3195":"THAT'S RIGHT! You must be some kind of mindreader! Maybe you should quit being a pilot and get a job reading palms down at the cantina!",		"s_3f68df7d":"Sounds easy enough.",		"s_3d6e04e6":"Oh boy. Here we go.",		"s_3c81c35":"What? ",		"s_3c7012a7":"No. I said I was good.",		"s_3afa07bf":"Hey! Don't be ungrateful. It's unattractive. If you want more, just ask me for another mission.",		"s_39d3e7a3":"I'm warning you now - it's the big time! Lots of unsavory elements flying around out there!",		"s_38a1649f":"Better make sure your blasters are operating at full capacity before you take off for Lok! Watch your back, %TU.",		"s_38264798":"GET TO WORK!",		"s_36a61f55":"OK! I get it! I'll get back to work!",		"s_35a6c533":"You've got it!",		"s_351c69aa":"Don't bother!

Do I think you can handle them? No. Why don't you go find your mama and quit bothering me.",		"s_312a9b56":"You never know.",		"s_30ea47ea":"There's CorSec, for one thing. Those guys are always mucking things up for us. Then you've got your stuck-up RSF forces. The Imperials would like us to straighten up and fly right - and that'll never happen! Even your old friend Lady Valarian is gunning for us, since we're aligned with Jabba.",		"s_30a9191e":"Hey! I've got no time for bums like you. ",		"s_30860224":"So I'm gunning for the Imperials.",		"s_303b5f14":"Hey! There's my favorite bum now. I have some surprising news here for you.",		"s_2e5c16e2":"Oh come on! You're kidding, right?

You're going to go on a goodwill mission.",		"s_293b395b":"Well...I want everybody to be free to do business with our smugglers, if that's what you mean! ",		"s_2836e6b5":"OK.",		"s_2313ac9e":"What are you talking about?",		"s_21cba89":"Pirate life, my friend! There's no black and white. It's all just shades of gray.",		"s_1d267ca4":"I can't really say, since I don't know. But it won't kill you to see this Admiral and hear what he has to say, right? He can't exactly force you to do anything for him, but there is a lot of things a pilot can learn from the Alliance.",		"s_1c8bddbb":"What is it?",		"s_1bfa482b":"Good job with those Valarian fighters! You really put them in their place.",		"s_1a5ce928":"Time is money! And you're wasting time! I don't do business with malingerers!",		"s_192c6747":"Not likely. The Black Sun have their own code of ethics when it comes to business. They stick to their own.",		"s_190e0e72":"Good point.",		"s_18b41c2f":"OK! So far, so good. Mission accomplished.

Surely you didn't come just to say hello.",		"s_1234129d":"Are you mocking me?",		"s_11ed6849":"Valarians are starting to get active around Dantooine. Too active, if you know what I mean.

Get to Dantooine and hurry up.",		"s_10c507d9":"Now that Jabba's content, we can go about our business.",		"s_10652869":"Try not to get killed. Get back out there.",		"s_1056a46b":"They sure are!
