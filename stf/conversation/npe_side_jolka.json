Come back later. I could use your help.",	"s_15":"Okay, I will.",	"s_17":"See you then.",	"s_19":"Don't worry, little R2 unit. I'll get you all fixed up. Oh, I didn't see you there. But I am glad you are here.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"You are?",	"s_23":"Yes, this R2 unit was damaged by blaster fire and is in desperate need of a new power converter.",	"s_25":"You can count on me!",	"s_26":"Have you gotten that power converter yet?",	"s_28":"No, I will get it right away.",	"s_29":"Good. Try to bring one back that isn't damaged.",	"s_30":"Please hurry.",	"s_32":"Where would I find it again?",	"s_33":"Where would I find one of those?",	"s_34":"Take it from one of the malfunctioning droids on the lower level.",	"s_36":"I hear there are some malfunctioning droids in the lower level. I am sure no one would mind if you borrowed one from them. Make sure to bring me one that is still intact and functional.",	"s_38":"Do you have the power converter?",	"s_39":"I will go there at once.",	"s_40":"Yes, here it is.",	"s_42":"Perfect! Thank you. Here, take these credits. The Wookiee was getting impatient.",	"s_43":"Thanks. The large Wookiee out there seems to like this droid. I'd hate for him to do something to me if I couldn't get it fixed.",	"s_45":"Thanks for all your help, %TU.",	"s_46":"I am busy right now."
