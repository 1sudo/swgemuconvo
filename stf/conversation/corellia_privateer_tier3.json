Come on; it's time for another lesson.",	"s_c123e137":"This would never have happened, if they hadn't taken advantage of our trusting nature. So it's payback time. I want you to go after the captain who radioed in for help. He's the guy who started this whole thing. ",	"s_c261cfae":"No problem.",	"s_c2675d2d":"We need to press our advantage.",	"s_c402784e":"See you soon.",	"s_c4d60644":"I'll say.",	"s_c69ddd08":"And that prison ship?",	"s_c816ccac":"Hey listen, we've ALL got work to do.",	"s_c8ea3e2b":"They cleaned my clock.",	"s_ca158be9":"Or vice versa.",	"s_cc075a69":"You sure did. We've messed up their plans, but good. And now we're going to press our advantage. ",	"s_cc4b75d1":"Not bad.",	"s_cc93ce57":"OK. I'll get them.",	"s_ccf2f65c":"You lost, buddy?",	"s_cd445db2":"I like the sound of that.",	"s_cfd01162":"Don't say that! You just had a setback. It's nothing to worry about. The REAL mistake would be giving up.",	"s_d11614d5":"Are you working with the pirates or something?",	"s_d24a2285":"Will do.",	"s_d2ab8937":"Then we're out of luck.",	"s_d30b5c72":"Nah.",	"s_d33d4e93":"No kidding.",	"s_d4866d33":"Exactly.",	"s_d4c80032":"My pleasure. Where can I find this guy?",	"s_d4f6cbf2":"Oh yeah? Well maybe I can help you with your problem. We've got a disabled pirate ship, floating dead above the planet.",	"s_d5206411":"It's not fixed?",	"s_d590d63c":"WHAT?!",	"s_d714b5a0":"Nope. Sure wasn't. But it's our problem now. The Black Suns must have brokered some kind of deal with the pirates.",	"s_d7bf7b44":"A pegleg and a parrot?",	"s_d8ec7fac":"I DON'T CARE!!",	"s_d9cced1f":"Absolutely.",	"s_dcc126b1":"Just doing my job.",	"s_ddb75eb1":"HAS he fixed it yet?",	"s_dde9d959":"Don't really care if they are. I'll see you when you get back.",	"s_de4a941c":"OK, but how?",	"s_dfe0e1a2":"What's going on up there?",	"s_e1260dbe":"Yeah. Well, we underestimated their interest in this area.",	"s_e26f7766":"If the Black Suns think we're giving up, they'll relax. Feel like they've won. And a relaxed enemy is easy to beat.",	"s_e48d5a":"I need to transfer out of this unit.",	"s_ea60e7f":"I just want a freaking solution!",	"s_edb238bc":"Go on.",	"s_eeb1457d":"What HAPPENED up there?! Those guys handed me my hat!",	"s_ef2c1d07":"Dead in the water! ",	"s_f0b69eb":"Any ideas about what to do next?",	"s_f313dc31":"They didn't exactly roll over and die. They went after that CorSec officer, after all.",	"s_f37012cf":"Golly! That didn't work out the way we planned it.",	"s_f436768c":"They must have been planning this all along.",	"s_f50b28e8":"I don't want to talk about it. I just want to accomplish something, for a change.",	"s_f61487ff":"What do you think?",	"s_f798d511":"Sheesh. Who knows? Doesn't matter now. All of a sudden we're looking at an enemy who's stronger than ever.",	"s_f89feda0":"You THINK?!!?",	"s_f9b4dab6":"The engineer you brought back? He's the guy who designed the original virus. I figure, he broke it, he can fix it too.",	"s_faab88c":"So what are we going to do?",	"s_fc05d09":"Tricky if it works, stupid if it doesn't. We'll see. Listen, for now, we're going to just lay low. We've got a CorSec ship out there. We want to transfer all those weapons and personnel to a ship that hangs lower in the planet's ozone layer.",	"s_fcf4d778":"How?"
