Walk along the river until you find some. You'll probably need to check more than one of the rivers that flow from below the waterfalls.",	"s_19":"I'm on my way.",	"s_2":"",	"s_21":"I'll be in communication with further instructions as needed.",	"s_34":"Let's see... was it two parts phosphoric acid? Or three? Oh, let's just try four and see what happens.",	"s_36":"Get everything I need for the neural boosters. Don't worry, I'll provide some for you as well.",	"s_37":"I trust my neural boosters worked as well as promised. I now have a much better stock of them. At least for now, anyway.",	"s_38":"Ah, good. I was told you were on your way, trooper. I'm afraid our stock of neural boosters are a bit low. I need you to help me restock before we move on the Mummers.",	"s_39":"What do I need to do?",	"s_40":"I'll need you to gather a few ingredients and some samples of the Mummer's toxin. To start with, go find some xharnoh plants and gather some of their roots. When you have enough roots, take them to the refining station and process them.",	"s_73":"This is everything I need. Thank you. I've been told to have you report to Sergeant Harriet Brunser who will oversee your assault on the Mummers.",	"s_74":"I understand. I'll go to Sgt. Brunser right away.",	"s_75":"Very good. Now, off with you. I need to start producing those boosters.",	"s_78":"I have not spoken to Sgt. Brunser.",	"s_79":"You haven't? Seems like you should. Go do so now. I think that's best."
