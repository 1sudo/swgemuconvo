Well, I'll be. I never thought he'd go that far.",	"s_44":"Any luck finding whoever tried to kill me? Not yet, eh? Well, keep at it. I have faith in you.",	"s_45":"Yes? May I be of service?",	"s_46":"Welcome to Kor Vella, home to some of the most cutting edge scientific research in the entire galaxy.",	"s_47":"I'm here to ask about the recent attempt on your life?",	"s_48":"Oh, that. Yes, well, just part of the job, I suppose. Not that I've ever experienced anything like that before, but it's not worth getting all worked up over. So, what can I do to help you?",	"s_49":"Do you know of anyone who might want to hurt you?",	"s_50":"Not specifically. But I have received some threatening messages recently. Over the past month or two. Or three even. These messages have gotten progressively more aggressive. Mostly they insist that I relinquish my office, or I'll suffer the consequences. I guess they weren't just being dramatic."
