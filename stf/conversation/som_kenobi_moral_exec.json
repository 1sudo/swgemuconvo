If you rip out the cables around the core and then steal the core itself, they won't have any way to repair it. They will have to come begging us to help them, in exchange for them going back to work, of course.",	"s_110":"You there. The corporation could use your assistance. Are you available at the moment?",	"s_111":"Sure am. What did you have in mind?",	"s_112":"That depends on what you need assistance with.",	"s_113":"No, sorry, not right now.",	"s_114":"No.",	"s_116":"Is there really no other way to solve the conflict?",	"s_127":"Oh believe me, friend, we've tried everything, but I don't think they are interested in a peaceful outcome at all. I believe their leader has convinced them to try and take over the corporation with violence!",	"s_128":"Alright, if there's no other way, I'll help you.",	"s_130":"Excellent. Their facility is up in the northwest part of the continent. Here, let me mark it down in your datapad. Your reward will be here waiting for you when you return with the core from their power generator.",	"s_132":"And they will just let me walk in there?",	"s_134":"Yeah, they are only hostile towards us, it seems like. The leader of the strike is fairly clever, though. You may want to sweet-talk him a little to make sure he doesn't interfere.",	"s_136":"This whole thing sounds fishy. I don't want to do it.",	"s_138":"Bah! I will find someone else then. Now move along!",	"s_139":"What are you doing back here already? Get out there and finish the job!",	"s_140":"There you are! Do you have the core?",	"s_142":"Yeah, I got it. I hope this will get a peaceful ending now.",	"s_144":"Of course I do. They didn't know what hit them.",	"s_145":"Haha, don't you worry about that. This is most excellent. Those fools won't have any choice but to come crawling back now.",	"s_146":"That is...great, I guess.",	"s_148":"It sure is! Very well, friend, you deserve your reward. Not only will I pay you the sum of 20,000 credits, but you will also receive this beautiful hologram of yours truly!",	"s_150":"What would I do with that?",	"s_152":"You should put it in your home to commemorate this fantastic day, of course! Now if you'll excuse me, I have to prepare for those maggots to come crawling back.",	"s_156":"Haha. Excellent! I like your style, my friend. This is splendid indeed. Those fools won't have any choice but to come crawling back now.",	"s_160":"This is all very interesting, but there was talk of a reward?",	"s_162":"Of course, of course. You are in for a treat, my friend. Not only will I pay you the sum of 20,000 credits, but you will also receive this beautiful hologram of yours truly!",	"s_165":"What the heck would I do with a hologram of you?!",	"s_169":"Now now, settle down there, buddy. You should put it in your home to commemorate this fantastic day, of course! Now if you'll excuse me, I have to prepare for those maggots to come crawling back.",	"s_171":"I don't believe we have anything more to say to each other now, do we?",	"s_2":"",	"s_45":"You have ruined me! I thought I could trust you, you rotting mynock!",	"s_47":"I'm busy and you're too wet behind the ears. Come back when you've gained some experience and I may have a job for you.",	"s_61":"You shouldn't be so quick to dismiss people of importance...",	"s_62":"I trust that you'll come back when you are.",	"s_63":"Of course it does. We have a bit of a problem with some miners that are on strike. We've tried reasoning with them, but they won't budge...claiming all sorts of preposterous things. It's time to end this nonsense and I've come up with a plan.",	"s_64":"This should be good...",	"s_65":"Oh, it will be. I need you to go in to their facility and destroy the power generator. If you rip out the cables around the core and then steal the core itself, they won't have any way to repair it. They will have to come begging us to help them, in exchange for them going back to work, of course.",	"s_66":"Not bad, that might work. Where is their camp?",	"s_68":"Might work but not something I'd do. Find someone else.",	"s_69":"Fine, I will! And don't you go talking about this to anyone, if you want to ever leave this planet in one piece!",	"s_70":"I knew you'd be the right one for the job. The facility is up in the northwest part of the continent. Here, let me mark it down in your datapad. Your reward will be here waiting for you when you return with the core from their power generator.",	"s_71":"Sounds good. What kind of resistance can I expect?",	"s_91":"They are just miners. Shouldn't pose a problem for you at all. The leader of the strike is fairly clever though. You may want to sweet talk him a little to make sure he doesn't interfere.",	"s_95":"We have a bit of a problem with some miners that are on strike. We've tried reasoning with them, but they won't budge...claiming all sorts of preposterous things. It's time to end this nonsense and I've come up with a plan.",	"s_99":"Alright, what have you come up with?"
