Have you heard about the time I crossed the Dune Sea without drinking even a single drop of water? Ha...who needs water when you've got a good Corellian ale!",	"s_14cd5816":"Oh, well then have you heard about the time I single-handedly defeated an entire unit of stormtroopers? It's true... they're really terrible at sabacc.",	"s_1eebe4c5":"Do you get the feeling we've done this before?  Anyway, as someone who enjoys exploring this waste of a planet, I've sometimes used painting as a journal of sorts to memorialize things I've seen. Those that truly made an impression on me and are unique to Tatooine.",	"s_3e426694":"Yeah, you've mentioned it before.",	"s_46c7e15a":"Say no more.   As someone who enjoys exploring this waste of a planet, I've sometimes used painting as a journal of sorts to memorialize things I've seen.

Have you heard about the time one of my paintings was featured in the Bestine Museum? That time is now! I encourage you to rush to Bestine and see for yourself.",	"s_ae2d8845":"Oh sure. Closest thing this planet has to an art museum. Though, have you heard about the time I tried to open an art gallery for Tusken Raiders? Ends up they really don't like art. Or maybe it was just me... I'm not sure.",	"s_b53cc4bf":"How could I not leap at the chance yet again!   Well, as someone who enjoys exploring this waste of a planet, I've sometimes used painting as a journal of sorts to memorialize things I've seen. Those that truly made an impression on me and are unique to Tatooine.",	"s_c53bdfa0":"All the way over in Bestine?",	"s_ead5e0b4":"The Bestine Museum is looking for more art to feature."
