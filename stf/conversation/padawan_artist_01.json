Arrgh, this is becoming annoying.",	"s_35c6bce6":"Thank you so much for retrieving my supplies. I'm not sure what I'll do about getting another assistant, but that's something I can worry about later.",	"s_4f3396fb":"Oh no, he will.  Sorry for not bringing this up before, but it is not the first time he has done this.  I know it's not the most glamorous job in the world, but I think a part of him sort of enjoys it.  Anyway, thank you for your help and for bringing my supplies.",	"s_593d8ed6":"Not yet. I'm still working on it.",	"s_5e1dfbcd":"Yes... you see if I don't get the supplies I need to make the paints I'm afraid I will not be able to finish my paintings.  Which means my patrons will not receive those paintings and will therefore not pay me. This in turn means I won't be able to pay my bills.",	"s_705f9dd1":"I haven't been able to find your assistant.",	"s_76f9d659":"I'm an aspiring artist working on some paintings using natural materials as the base for my paints.  The texture and brilliance of the colors I get using them echoes the emotions I try to express in my work.   I sent my assistant out to retrieve some more supplies but he has yet to return.",	"s_78bd6c2":"Thank you. Let me know when you find him.",	"s_81192d80":"Lady, you're a freak. Get a real job and leave the rest of us alone.",	"s_8bed149":"My assistant is out collecting a mixture of mud and refuse that is just right for the colors I need.  If you could please meet him there and assist him in returning safely I would be ever appreciative.  I have given you a waypoint to his location.  Please hurry.",	"s_a0e28661":"No and I'm not going to. Find him yourself.",	"s_a1ae198d":"Have you found my assistant yet?",	"s_a2c41722":"I'm afraid your assistant will not be coming back... but I have your supplies.",	"s_a51658ea":"Excuse me?",	"s_a8a01106":"Your excuses are as transparent as a Twi'lek entertainers clothing.  Lets both just forget I asked.",	"s_a95dd416":"What? But... you... I see. Very well. I see how your true colors now.",	"s_aad1f131":"Where is my assistant?",	"s_bdf1fbc8":"Sounds... interesting.",	"s_c4960c85":"Who are you?  Never mind, I think we both know that doesn't matter.",	"s_cc45360d":"Did you even try? I'm not sure why I bothered to ask for your help.",	"s_d21432e3":"I did get your supplies though.",	"s_ec321028":"Oh. Maybe I spoke hastily. But how did you know what to get? [check the supplies] Yes, these all look correct. I'm impressed. Ever think about becoming an artist's assistant?",	"s_f9a16624":"I get the picture. What can I do to help?"
