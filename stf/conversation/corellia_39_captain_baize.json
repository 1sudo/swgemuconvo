Luckily, our Public Relations department was able to convince Kazic Pendre, as well as the local media, that it was a botched robbery. Which means, you might have another chance to go after Pendre. But don't make the same mistake again! Do you understand?",	"s_35":"Be careful when going after Kazic Pendre. As far as we can tell, all of the employees at his business, Pendretronics, are normal, hard working people with no criminal records. Do not harm any of them.",	"s_36":"I need to take a small break for a while",	"s_37":"I see. Well, I suppose this is as good a time as any.",	"s_38":"From reports I've gathered, you are making headway with Jzoro. Soon he'll trust you enough to let you access his central computers. Keep up the good work.",	"s_39":"Once you've gained Jzoro's trust, download all information he has about the Chirq Council from his central mainframe. We should be able to determine who the leaders of the Chirq Council are from that information.",	"s_40":"Good. We'll switch the spice you collected with some poor quality spice that we've diluted with a common medicinal powder. It's unlikely that Jzoro will notice, but even if he does, he'll blame the Monumenters.",	"s_41":"You have been authorized to use this terminal to make a fake CorSec ID. Go ahead.",	"s_42":"We have it! We know now that the Chirq Council is governed by nine members who call themselves the Elite Council. Your next task is simple enough, though quite dangerous: Eliminate the Elite Council.",	"s_47":"Don't worry. I can take care of them.",	"s_48":"I have no doubt. According to the information you downloaded from Jzoro, the Elite Council has two bases outside of town. Start with the one south of town. ",	"s_49":"Magnificently done! Reports are already coming in that say the Chirq Council is splintering. Without the discipline and motivation provided by the Elite Council, they are turning on one another and falling to pieces. You have done a remarkable job, and your service to Corellia has not gone unnoticed.",	"s_51":"Eliminate all members of the Elite Council. Our hope is that without its leadership, that the Chirq Council will dissolve into chaos and disarray.",	"s_55":"Continue your investigation into the attempted assassination of the mayor of Kor Vella.",	"s_56":"Well done. We've put Trins Evnar under observation and have no doubt of his connection to the Chirq Council. Now you will take his place. Most people in the Chirq Council will only  know Trins Evnar by name, but a few will know his face, gender, and species. We'll need to find out who they are and make certain that they cannot hinder your progress.",	"s_57":"How do I get started?",	"s_58":" First, you need to go to Trins Evnar's house and take his place. Be sure to collect as much data on him as you can while you're there.",	"s_60":"Well met, %TO. I trust Lt. Cope has already briefed you on your mission here in Doaba Guerfel. If we are to bring down the Chirq Council, we must do so from within. Therefore, you will need to infiltrate the Chirq Council as one of their own. Once you've done that, we can take down their leaders.",	"s_61":"Trins Evnar must be removed from the area, and information about his contacts within the Chirq Council must be collected.",	"s_62":"Based on the information you gathered at Trins Evnar's house, we now know who his direct contacts within the Chirq Council were. You will need to take them down in order to insure that they cannot get in your way.",	"s_63":"I'm on my way.",	"s_64":"Good luck to you.",	"s_65":"Continue to eliminate Trins Evnar's Chirq Council contacts.",	"s_66":"Well done thus far, but the most dangerous part is next. Trins Evnar reported to Kazic Pendre, who, in turn, reported to a man named Jzoro Quanera. You need to report to Jzoro and convince him that you're ready to move up in the organization.",	"s_67":"I'm on my way.",	"s_68":"You'll find Jzoro Quanera in a bunker outside of town. You might want to be careful venturing too far into his bunker. Most of his henchmen don't trust strangers and are likely to attack you.",	"s_69":"I'll be careful.",	"s_70":"I'm sure you will.",	"s_71":"Work with Jzoro as best you can to prove your loyalty, but be sure not to commit any actual crimes. I'll help you with that, if needed.",	"s_72":"I'll get started immediately.",	"s_73":"Very good. We'll upload coordinates to you as you need them.",	"s_74":"I'm on my way.",	"s_75":"Good luck, and may the Force be with you.",	"s_76":"Thank you. It was my honor.",	"s_77":"The hero returns. Corellia is a much safer place, thanks to you. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of other dangers out there. But the Chirq Council threatened to be one of the worst. We're well rid of them. Thank you.",	"s_78":"No, the honor was all mine. Though apparently others wish to share in that honor. CorSec agent Taarna wishes to speak with you, though I do not know the reason.",	"s_80":"What do you need me to do?",	"s_82":"First we need to find a confirmed member of the Chirq Council. To help with that, you will contact an undercover agent already working here in Doaba Guerfel. She will have your best leads on finding someone in the Chirq Council. She awaits you at the shuttleport.",	"s_84":"I'll go speak with her.",	"s_86":"Good. Be careful not to blow her cover.",	"s_88":"I don't have time to help with this right now.",	"s_89":"Yes, I understand.",	"s_90":"Good. Let's not go through this again.",	"s_92":"I see. For the sake of this investigation, I hope that you can make time soon. Or perhaps I'll give the assignment to the next person who comes along.",	"s_93":"I am happy to have been of service.",	"s_94":"Thank you. And your service might continue, if you wish. Agent Taarna would like to speak with you.",	"s_96":"Crime rates have risen all over Corellia lately. It is up to the Corellian Security Forces to find out why."
