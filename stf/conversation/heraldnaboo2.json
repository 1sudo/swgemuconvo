Let me download the information into your datapad. I must be well on my way. It's feeding time for the veermok. It's such a sight to see!",	"s_401feeb9":"Maybe some other time, then. Maybe you'd rather visit the Gungans at their stronghold. They're always looking for new allies. They're my allies, in fact, and very supportive of my research. If you're not interested, I really must get going. I hope you don't mind.",	"s_48315a3d":"I think I'll visit them too.",	"s_60613aaf":"Bye!",	"s_7d197017":"Where are the Gungans?",	"s_8182146c":"I have to go too. Bye!",	"s_91946cec":"I apologize. I'm in a bit of a hurry. I only planned to be here in this city for only a few hours. Gathering these supplies took longer than I thought. I really must get back to my studies..",	"s_9adfee98":"What do you study?",	"s_adb2e1e":"Okay. I'll let you go.",	"s_b2b33aae":"You and I are so alike. They don't like visitors much, but maybe you can ally with them as well. Let me download the information into your datapad, assuming you have one.",	"s_b6fc48e0":"So, where are these veermoks?",	"s_c4e2d7fa":"Oh yes! I babble on and on so much. I'll just download the information into your datapad. It's really the quickest way. I really must get going.",	"s_d482409c":"The veermok, of course! Have you seen a more interesting creature? I take every chance I can get to educate others on my findings. Too bad I don't have the time right now! You can go see them yourself, if you'd like.",	"s_d6695e83":"No thanks.",	"s_fcab5bd8":"You're interested in them as much as I am! How exciting! After I gather my supplies, I'm headed to the Gungan Stronghold, however. I have some deals to conduct with my allies there. The Gungans are really friendly when you get to know them. I'll be off to my studies after that. It's the veermok's feeding time."
