		"s_ff872480":"Yes I would. Thank you for the second chance.",		"s_f9732f00":"Simply use the device's menu and choose to activate the tracking device. If you're on the wrong planet, it will tell you which planet the satellite is on. Once you're on the correct planet, the device can then pinpoint the exact location of the satellite.",		"s_f75c2f80":"I'd like a waypoint to the gadget specialist in Keren.",		"s_ec479e11":"Yes, hello. You've returned the rest of your reward?",		"s_eac5593c":"No, I'm doing just fine. I'll leave you to your work.",		"s_e77051e7":"I don't have time to speak. Too much to do. Too much to do and not enough time. Too frantic. Arrgh.",		"s_e3e36f42":"I have a replacement computer core for the village.",		"s_e0f6c467":"Ah enthusiasm... I like that. 

Before getting started, you should know that in this village, you cannot work with more than one villager. So while you're working with me, you can't work with any other villagers.",		"s_dd8b435":"My pleasure. Ask if they can supply a replacement core. Then return here and bring it to me. Thanks and may the Force guide you.",		"s_dc34bd9c":"Fair enough. If you decide you'll be able to help, I'll be here. Now let's see... which emergency was I working on...",		"s_d38355d4":"Excellent. And may the Force guide you. Return to me once you've obtained the replacement core.",		"s_cbc96768":"Arrrgh! It's too much! I'm only one person... and new to this position no less. How can I be expected to keep the village defenses working while we're under attack? It's too much!!",		"s_caa53683":"That's quite alright. Okay, first I need to... something. Maybe I'll start... no no. Obviously. Well. Something.",		"s_c7baf80c":"What do I do with this tracking device kit?",		"s_bf01c6a4":"Well, I know some people who might be able to help you find one. You'd need to contact one of them and see what they have to say. From there, both they and I can advise you.

In exchange for this service, I'd be happy to help you unlock the secrets that will lead you toward mastering the art of repair.",		"s_bce29099":"We would also like to present you with this section of an Aurilian sculpture as further thanks for your help. But it seems that you do not have room in your inventory for it at the moment. Please make some room and then speak with me again.",		"s_bab2829b":"How do I get tracking data for a fallen satellite?",		"s_b69a10cf":"I'd recommend speaking to a gadget specialist. I've done business with a gadget specialist in the past and know where you can find one. Actually, I know of three of them. One in Keren on Naboo, on in Mos Entha on Tatooine, and one in Coronet on Corellia. I can upload a waypoint to their location if you'd like?",		"s_acbab09c":"Those freaks are attacking. Everything is breaking. I can't believe I accepted this chief engineering post. What was I thinking. Ah well, there's nothing for it now but to muddle through.",		"s_a69082f1":"No thanks. Not this time.",		"s_a2e520b8":"Can you remind me where I need to go to find a replacement computer core?",		"s_9caa26f9":"Thank you, that's very kind. Normally I would gladly accept your help, but at the moment I'm already juggling more people and problems than I can handle. Please come back after some time has passed and I'll see if I can phase you in.",		"s_9c2a9f48":"Oh. Okay. Thank you. I think. I suppose I'll manage, Somehow.",		"s_96e10fe0":"I see. Thank you for coming by. If you'll excuse me, I've much to do.",		"s_94925b50":"Eh, no thanks. Sounds boring. I'll pass.",		"s_8ef5f872":"Ah yes. The core's current interface will need to be modified so that it will be compatible with computers here in the village. There should be a simple menu you can access on the core itself that will allow you to attempt the modification. Be careful though... if you fail too often you could short out the core and render it useless.",		"s_8e1d9e8a":"I'll do it. Where can I find a replacement computer core?",		"s_8b482724":"As further token of the village's thanks, we would like to present to you this section of an Aurilian sculpture.",		"s_860baf7e":"Yes! Thank you! This will work perfectly. In exchange for your services, I will happily get you started on the road to the Mastery of Crafting Repair.",		"s_85cf8e18":"Oh. Hmmm... maybe I should think about this a bit more.",		"s_7f1e8a0c":"I'd like a waypoint to the gadget specialist in Mos Entha.",		"s_7f1492c":"That's not a problem. How do I get started on this?",		"s_7496bddd":"Do you know how this satellite tracking device works?",		"s_742ff942":"Oh, that's not good. Please hurry. Our backup is not going to last much longer.",		"s_6c741657":"No, no, no... it'll have to wait. 

Sorry, sorry. Just trying to sort some things out. You're the one helping with the replacement core, right? If I can answer any questions, just ask. ",		"s_69b44245":"No waypoint needed. I'll speak to them and get you a replacement computer core.",		"s_65f76975":"Go to any ticket droid at a starport. They have access to the database with information about fallen and abandoned satellites around the galaxy. You can purchase the rights to one of them from the droid.",		"s_6516bd5a":"Yes, I've made room and returned as you asked",		"s_64391455":"It's you... good. Did you find a replacement computer core? Have you configured it so that it will be compatible with our computers?",		"s_61fa9d29":"Hmm... what would that mean I'd have to do?",		"s_59f634d7":"I'd like a waypoint to the gadget specialist in Coronet.",		"s_59f5cee6":"Is there anything I can do to help?",		"s_5542b04b":"Oh, my apologies. I'll let you get back to work.",		"s_5062e892":"You worked with the last chief engineer, right? But weren't able to find a replacement in time. Would you like to try again? Continue from where you left off?",		"s_50191de0":"Hmmm... you don't appear to have the computer core with you. Please return when you have it.",		"s_4bcdc402":"You need to collect or craft all of the required components and place them in the kit. Once you have all of the components, the kit's automated system will build the tracking device.",		"s_4294034a":"No, It's... um... not ready yet.",		"s_4136c2df":"Thank you very much.",		"s_3196d2e0":"Right. Well then I've wasted enough time talking. There's much for me to attend to.",		"s_3031b4c9":"Excellent. Continue from where you left off. Come speak with me again if you have any questions.",		"s_29e5661":"Right. Good. Come back if you find a replacement. Or if you have any questions.",		"s_29622c26":"There's one in Keren on Naboo, on in Mos Entha on Tatooine, and one in Coronet on Corellia. I can upload a waypoint to their location if you'd like?",		"s_1a960799":"Yes. Yes there is. During the first of the recent attacks on the village, our primary computer was damaged, and the computer core has become unstable. A new core must be found as soon as possible. Thanks to all the damage being caused by the attacks, I am unable go find a replacement, but you could go get one in my place.",		"s_199cece6":"Ah, good to see you again. Have you had a chance to develop your mastery of crafting and repair? No wait... don't answer. I wish I had more time to speak, but I'm so very busy. I must get back to work.",		"s_174ddced":"I've changed my mind. You're on your own. Good luck... I guess.",		"s_121666b3":"Success, the replacement computer core is ready!",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (fs_phase4_chief_engineer.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
