Bossk left specific instructions on that. Something about you needing to DIE!",	"s_12":"Okay, okay. You win. Don't hurt me any more. I can't believe I let Bossk talk me into attacking you so he could keep the entire bounty. What a ridiculous idea. Here, take a weapon. I'm clearly not qualified to use any of them. And take the paltry salary that Bossk sends to me. It's not much, but I hope you choke on it.",	"s_15":"You're here, finally. Bossk let me know that you were on your way. I have the information you'll need for each of the bounties. I'll upload it to your journal. Now, get to work. When you finish with these bounties, I can finally get off of this forsaken planet.",	"s_16":"Look, we're done. We have no more business together. If it will get you away from me, I'll let you know if I hear of something else you can do in the area. But I have nothing for now.",	"s_2":"",	"s_29":"I wonder why I haven't heard from Bossk in so long. He should have handled these bounties by now.",	"s_30":"Yes, yes. You're back. Bravo. Well done and all that. I suppose I should thank you...I might actually be able to leave now. So...thank you.",	"s_37":"Go on. If you don't act quickly, the intel I've provided will be useless.",	"s_7":"We're done. We have no more business together. If it will get you away from me, I'll let you know if I hear of something else you can do in the area. But I have nothing for now."
