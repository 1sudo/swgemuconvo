You have done well. It looks like we are out of trouble. I don't know how to thank you but maybe this will help expess our gratitude.",	"s_85":"We are not out of the woods yet. More attackers are reported to be coming in. Get ready to throw them back.",	"s_87":"So are you here from Ssiksik to help us out?",	"s_89":"Yes, I have come to rescue you.",	"s_91":"Great. I am not sure how you managed to make it in but we are surrounded. We managed to fight off the initial attack but I don't think we can hold out for much longer. Those Wookiees have been attacking us every few moment. Get ready because my scouts report they are massing for another attack.",	"s_93":"Not now. I am sort of in the middle of something."
