I need to think. On one hand, I do really want to get off of this forsaken rock. But on the other hand, I don't really like the idea of being beholden to Jabba the Hutt or to Lady Valarian.",	"s_43eb0d5":"I could join the military. To be honest, I don't really like the way the Empire seems to treat their pilots. They seem too much like fodder to me. I'm leaning toward the Rebel Alliance. I'm hoping I can fly with them until I'm able to support myself.",	"s_58da73fe":"Seems like Rebel pilots are killed just as often as Imperial ones.",	"s_5ce080f5":"True enough. But at least the Rebels seem to care when they lose a pilot. Might just be because they have so many fewer, but there's not really a better choice for me.",	"s_c088465d":"What other choice do you have?"
