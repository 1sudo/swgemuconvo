Can you believe it? And last, but not least, they raided our pension funds.",	"s_17b4bc37":"Good. Who needs you, anyway?",	"s_19104f66":"(Give 100 credits)",	"s_1a2b4bd6":"You have proof of this?",	"s_1aea5dd4":"What difference does it make?",	"s_1af6e3a2":"Um. Yeah. I can't talk right now.",	"s_1c18efb1":"Excuse me. Can you spare a credit for an old veteran CorSec pilot?",	"s_1c7c9ce0":"The Empire froze CorSec retirement funds and forced out everyone with any sort of spot on their record! They say we're Rebels! Ridiculous.",	"s_1ca480f5":"You're crazy.",	"s_1eecbc00":"Unfair!",	"s_1f7981ec":"Nobody important. You fly for the Empire, huh?",	"s_2313ac9e":"What are you talking about?",	"s_264b3207":"You said it!",	"s_2683bb8f":"How is the Empire responsible?",	"s_2812a379":"Thank you! Times have been really tough since the Empire started losing the war! CorSec's turned upside-down... RSF's been turned upside-down... there's no way for a pilot to make a decent living anymore!",	"s_2992b933":"Get a job.",	"s_2a27a72e":"Back when I was flying 'sports, we weren't allowed to fly for more than two days straight. Now that's all over! Pilots are pressed into constant service and they're falling asleep at the controls. Equipment doesn't get adequate downtime, so accidents are up a thousand percent!",	"s_2a33c404":"What? No pension for you?",	"s_34556faa":"Well you just try it yourself! Ride the shuttles for a while. Better yet - take a 'sport to some exotic place like Dantooine. You'll see what I mean!",	"s_34f6c18f":"I plan to fly for the Empire.",	"s_3541bf7":"That's what I thought. Get out of here.",	"s_366389b9":"The Empire has nothing to do with the RSF!",	"s_3daae2ee":"Do I know you?",	"s_3e8d294c":"Are you?",	"s_3f5509de":"Oh yes! The public-relations folks will tell ya different - but CorSec and the RSF are now fully, one-hundred percent, and unashamedly under the Emperor's thumb!",	"s_428087e9":"What's happening here?",	"s_4294df70":"Oh no? ",	"s_455169a0":"Travel is not restricted.",	"s_46663cbe":"Upside-down?",	"s_47744716":"I find that hard to believe.",	"s_49eaf107":"Nope. Can't help you.",	"s_4b74e148":"It's a sore spot for me because I happen to hate the Empire for what it's done to me and my friends at CorSec! You know what I'm talking about?",	"s_4e213b9f":"Ha! Ha! Ha! That's a laugh!",	"s_4f68d18f":"I've seen a bunch of Imperial types coming and going from the hotel up the street. You guys having some sort of convention?",	"s_4fbbd27f":"I had a job. Used to fly for CorSec. Now I'm out on the street because of the Empire!",	"s_5034aab7":"I don't respect beggars.",	"s_54fb5f5d":"Not now, maybe... but you mark my words! The Empire is an evil force in the galaxy. Don't let it trap you.",	"s_558fa93c":"Oh nothing. Nothing you would believe, at least! The Empire has stomped its way into CorSec and has taken control of everything. They... and I would guess you... are running CorSec and the RSF into the ground!",	"s_55b16c5b":"You should be ashamed of yourself!",	"s_55b16c62":"Yes. Hate the Empire.",	"s_576d00c5":"You've got a lot to learn, my friend.",	"s_591c9c49":"Really? You have no idea... do you?",	"s_5b204877":"What can I do?",	"s_63520a89":"I would urge you to quit.",	"s_67f5202c":"Oh! Thank you very much!",	"s_6a6e024a":"The Empire kicked down the doors to CorSec and confiscated starships, weapons... even our side-arms! Can you believe it? And last, but not least, they raided our pension funds.",	"s_6ce3ead6":"The Empire has forced all planetary governments to abandon the safety regulations for pilots, shuttles and interplanetary transports!",	"s_757d93fb":"Yes I do.",	"s_763e6d5":"Make the right choice, friend. Don't help the Empire. Fight for freedom instead!",	"s_77258083":"Do you now? That's a terrible shame. Just terrible...",	"s_77e48d5b":"What do you mean?",	"s_78ae72a2":"You have a lot to learn, my friend.",	"s_78b67180":"Relax, old man.",	"s_79ec01f7":"You're probably behind it all...",	"s_7c3dc1ab":"Because they're going crazy trying to freeze people's assets, inspect communications, and restrict travel.",	"s_7eee531":"A hard road, my friend... but I respect the choice. If I were only younger, I would go with you and sign up!",	"s_8252a913":"What makes you think the Empire is losing?",	"s_82f0aea5":"Hmph.",	"s_87f655c5":"Can you spare some credits, my friend?",	"s_892ffb49":"You here for the rally?",	"s_8be640b8":"Sure.",	"s_8f4bce76":"I plan to join the Alliance Navy.",	"s_958a863c":"How do they justify that?",	"s_968710ca":"You do? That's good. Very good. You're still young enough to do something about it, eh?",	"s_9756c395":"What? What are you talking about?! Get out of here! I don't need this grief!",	"s_97aef052":"Of course I'm right!",	"s_9df7e4c2":"No. I don't.",	"s_9f2e17a3":"Figured as much.",	"s_a761aa1e":"Figured as much!",	"s_b21356c8":"No. Why?",	"s_b25e0684":"Nobody. Just an out-of-work CorSec pilot. Forced into retirement by your superiors. How do you like that?",	"s_b93aa42e":"Then be careful...",	"s_b9b4cdf3":"We got a notice from the Empire stating that all secure CorSec funds were frozen for inspection. Something about us being tied in with the Alliance.",	"s_bab29e60":"Yeah! Crazy like a durni! Get out of here!",	"s_baf2d521":"I've seen Imperials coming and going from the hotel down the street. You want to tangle with them?",	"s_bb54f6cc":"None of your business.",	"s_c30cfa8b":"Well, it should! And you should have more respect!",	"s_c3c03121":"Are you kidding me? Space pirates, the so-called 'Smugglers Alliance' is a deathtrap! Pilots don't last longer than a few weeks. If you don't get locked up by one of my pals in CorSec, or blown up by a TIE patrol... likely one of your 'friends' will do you in for a profit!",	"s_c45af70d":"Imperial efficiency, of course!",	"s_c4d665ba":"I don't believe you.",	"s_c8291538":"Maybe I should become a space pirate?",	"s_ca776e30":"Who are you?",	"s_cb58d836":"You are very kind.",	"s_cbc9bfc1":"You know... I really shouldn't say any more. You've got your choices to make now. Good luck!",	"s_cdc41c9f":"Yeah, right.",	"s_cf3b2658":"I have nothing to do with it.",	"s_d79019d0":"But shuttle times are much shorter now!",	"s_daa001f6":"Who cares?",	"s_db730888":"No. Nobody knows me.",	"s_de0c6e64":"CorSec is still fully independent!",	"s_e28320c1":"(Give 25 credits)",	"s_e3717de2":"Maybe you're right.",	"s_e529f302":"And... so...?",	"s_e5ddc8b8":"Mark my words! The wages of piracy... are death.",	"s_eb4e939":"Of course I do!",	"s_ec3ffcdb":"Begone with you! I don't need this sort of grief!",	"s_ed52be64":"Yes. I know.",	"s_ed8c4da8":"And do you know why?",	"s_f06b7dcf":"All right. Tell me.",	"s_f2319d89":"Why you! Get out of here! I don't deserve this grief!",	"s_f2841236":"Because you're aiding the Rebellion?",	"s_f2dc9195":"Forget it!",	"s_f52972fb":"Heh. Not anymore. Not thanks to the Empire!",	"s_f6046c2a":"That's a lie!",	"s_f8411238":"Believe what you will. It's your funeral!",	"s_f95334":"What rally?",	"s_ff607592":"What's it to you?",	"s_ff739c7e":"It doesn't bother me, old man!"
