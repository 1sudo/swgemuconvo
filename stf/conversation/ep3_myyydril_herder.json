We, the Myyydril people, harvest them for their meats. Not only are their meat wonderful to the taste, they also make great pets. The ones you see here are small and immature. We keep them safe until it is time for the harvesting. Of course, some are hostile... There are hostile Uwari in the caverns above us.",	"s_490":"And the mushrooms?",	"s_492":"Luilris Mushrooms. They make great pies and are wonderful light sources. They grow in dark, damp areas like this. We have multiple mushroom gardens, as I'm sure you've already seen.",	"s_494":"Thank you for the information.",	"s_496":"[The herder nods.] Watch yourself around here. It can be dangerous.",	"s_674":"Rrwoorr!"
