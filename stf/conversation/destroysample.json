I'll let you know if there's something else we need done.",		"s_e0f3deb6":"It's good to be seen.",		"s_df17f706":"Nice to meet you, Trent.  I've got a job you might be interested in.  My faction wants help in making things difficult for the Empire.  If you can destroy 5 Tie Fighters, I'll pay you 3,000 credits.",		"s_cdc3b4c7":"I have plenty of reasons for hurting the Empire.  Sign me up.",		"s_cdb71c15":"Hey there Trent.  Do you have the sensor logs confirming your kills?",		"s_c1fc410f":"Well, you aren't likely to find better around here.  I've got someone else to meet.  Talk to you later.",		"s_bc9b15b3":"Nice to see you, Trent.",		"s_73b20bfc":"Take your time.

Come back when you have real results.",		"s_32900dd8":"Ah, nicely done!  My people will transfer the credits right away.  You did a good job.",		"s_28969bdd":"Excellent.  I'll wire the credits to your account when you bring me sensor validation of the kills.  Good luck.",		"s_157082a":"Wouldn't that be murder?  I don't think I can take that job.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (destroysample.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
