Yeah he and I worked on the fryer.  I put in the Oil Filtration System.  It was basically responsible for filtering out food remnants left behind in the frying process. ",	"s_16":"Why does the oil need to be filtered?",	"s_18":"Well, you can't really leave the food in the oil or it will eventually burn.  The filter unit in the fryer circulates the oil and catches and destroys food particles so you can use the same oil repeatedly.",	"s_19":"Ahh...I see.",	"s_2":"",	"s_20":"Anything else?",	"s_24":"I was about to ask you the same.  Do you know anything else about the fryer?",	"s_25":"Not enough to help you.  You might want to speak to my old factory manager Nore Brrea.  I will give you a datapad location.",	"s_26":"I haven't seen anyone out here in a while.  You must be lost.",	"s_4":"I haven't seen anyone out here in a while.  You lost?",	"s_9":"No. I am looking for Lepwalk C'han.  Wanted to ask him about reverse engineering this fryer."
