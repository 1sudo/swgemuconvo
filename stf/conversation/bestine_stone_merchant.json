		"s_f56c7c9f":"Do you have more stones for me?",		"s_eaee4954":"No, just looking around. See ya later!",		"s_e21cea57":"You do?! What kind of stones?",		"s_d7a9bace":"Oh... okay. Well, if you decide you'd rather get it off your hands, feel free to seek me out! I'll surely buy them off you.",		"s_cc49587f":"Wow! That's just what I'm looking for! I can take it off your hands if you want. I need to test every one very carefully. So what do you say? Which one do you want to give me?",		"s_bb2c2468":"Thank you! Here, I'll give you this. We'll say you bought it from me by giving me the stone. It's rare so guard it closely.",		"s_b6f71f8a":"I have a carved stone.",		"s_b6e7bea1":"Yes, I do. I have a carved stone.",		"s_b04b4ef5":"Alright. If you have any stones, be sure to come back!",		"s_af35650e":"I have a smooth stone.",		"s_af25c425":"Yes, I do. I have a smooth stone.",		"s_9e6e06eb":"You will? Too bad I don't know where they are. I heard a rumor that Victor Visalis may know. He's over at the capitol. He doesn't usually talk about things other than the election. Maybe if he won the election... oh well. If you ever find any, I'm here.",		"s_98e55c89":"I may have the stones you are looking for.",		"s_8c741032":"I'm going to keep it.",		"s_8762f9f":"I'm in the business of collecting rare stones. Unfortunately, I haven't had much business lately. I guess I should find another business.",		"s_4242e25b":"Probably. Bye!",		"s_38d8cf30":"I'll give you the smooth stone.",		"s_2b5e768f":"I guess so. I'll look for some.",		"s_211ab5b4":"I'll give you the carved stone.",		"s_1cb401b5":"I'll keep searching!",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (bestine_stone_merchant.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
