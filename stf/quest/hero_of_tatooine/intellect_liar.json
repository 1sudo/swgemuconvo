		"bh_lose":"No, no. That can't be right, it doesn't make sense at all. I guess I'll just have to figure it out myself.",		"bh_win":"You're right, that does make sense. Thanks for your help, I'll take care of it from here.",		"sui_btn_cancel":"Nevermind",		"sui_btn_ok":"Point Him Out",		"sui_title":"Bounty Hunter",		"sui_prompt":"Choose the smuggler that you believe stole the equipment:",		"rank":"a smuggler captain",		"others_5_2":"Everything that %TO says is a dirty lie. You can't believe a word that comes out of his mouth.",		"others_5_1":"That %TO is a filthy liar. Everyone here knows it.",		"others_5_0":"Whatever %TO said is a lie.  I've been cheated by that that poor excuse for a smuggler enough times to know.",		"others_4_2":"Both %TO and %TU are kind of shady, but only one is a liar, the other isn't. And we all know that %TT is definately a liar.",		"others_4_1":"I know for a fact that %TT is a liar. And I know that either %TO or %TU is lying, but the other isn't.",		"others_4_0":"%TT isn't telling the truth; either %TO or %TU is lying, the other is not.",		"others_3_2":"I know that %TT and %TO are both liars. Don't listen to a word they say.",		"others_3_1":"I overheard %TT and %TO talking earlier. They are both liars, don't trust either of them.",		"others_3_0":"Don't trust %TT and %TO, both of them are lying.",		"others_2_2":"I'll tell you what. I've been around and I hear things. And I'm sure it's either %TT or %TO that the bounty hunter is looking for.",		"others_2_1":"I'm almost positive that either %TT or %TO is the culprit. I've heard of them getting caught up in situtations like this before.",		"others_2_0":"I know for a fact that the bounty hunter is looking for %TT or %TO.  They are both considered scum, even among smugglers.  I wouldn't be surprised if one of them stooped to petty thievery.",		"others_1_2":"Both %TO and I have nothing to do with all this. That's all I can say.",		"others_1_1":"I'm innocent I tell you, and so is %TO. Now leave us be.",		"others_1_0":"Neither %TO nor I have anything to do with this, leave us alone.",		"others_0_2":"Yea, I know most of these rogues pretty well. Three of them are pretty honest. The other two are down right dirty liars, I wouldn't trust a word they say.",		"others_0_1":"There's really not much that I can tell you. I know most of these smugglers pretty well though. Two of them are compulsive liars. The others are pretty trusworthy.",		"others_0_0":"I don't really know what I can tell you, other than this piece of advice.  I know the smugglers in this town fairly well.  Two of them always lie.  You can only trust the other three.",		"bye_11":"Fine.",		"bye_10":"So, you believe me, right?",		"bye_9":"Remember, I didn't do it.",		"bye_8":"So long.",		"bye_7":"Go tell that bounty hunter that I'm not the one she's looking for, eh?",		"bye_6":"Am I free to go?",		"bye_5":"Stop wasting my time.",		"bye_4":"Go on, get out of here, twerp.",		"bye_3":"Whatever.",		"bye_2":"Get lost.",		"bye_1":"'Bye.",		"bye_0":"Good-bye.",		"equipment_11":"Nothing. Can I go now?",		"equipment_10":"Geez, you're as bad as that bounty hunter. I don't know anything, alright?",		"equipment_9":"Why are you harassing me? Go find the person that actually stole the stuff!",		"equipment_8":"Stop asking pointless questions.",		"equipment_7":"For all we know, maybe YOU stole it.",		"equipment_6":"I know I didn't steal it. That's about it.",		"equipment_5":"Nothing. Nothing at all.",		"equipment_4":"Don't you two have anything better to do than hound me with questions? Get off my back.",		"equipment_3":"I'll tell you what I told that bounty hunter. I didn't steal anything.",		"equipment_2":"Look, what I do might not be legal, but I don't steal.",		"equipment_1":"I don't know nothin' about no stolen equipment.",		"equipment_0":"I don't know anything about the stolen equipment.",		"response_2":"Thank you for your time.",		"response_1":"What do you know about the other smugglers?",		"response_0":"What do you know about the stolen equipment?",		"greeting_11":"I just want to get back to work. I'm tired of answering questions.",		"greeting_10":"Curse the luck. I've got a package coming in today, but that bounty hunter won't let me leave.",		"greeting_9":"What is it? I'm very very busy.",		"greeting_8":"Look, I really need to think about my next job.  What is it that you want?",		"greeting_7":"I wonder how long until that bounty hunter gives up or just kills us all?",		"greeting_6":"Smuggling has been tough with the Empire's recent crackdown.  The rebels hurt them bad and now everyone's feeling the effects.",		"greeting_5":"I've got a flight path to plan, but that idiot of a bounty hunter keeps interrupting me with questions.  Kinda like you.",		"greeting_4":"I love my job.  The thrill of a light cruiser pushing past a blockade at full speed!  You never feel that way down here on the surface.",		"greeting_3":"The Empire has been pretty busy with the Rebellion lately.  Makes it easy to slip past with extra goods.  I would think they sent that bounty hunter to investigate, but she doesn't seem very smart.",		"greeting_2":"Until this bounty hunter moves on, I won't be able to inspect that new shipment I just received.",		"greeting_1":"Business is good!  I just moved twice my normal load this week.  Now if that bounty hunter would get lost I could get back to work.",		"greeting_0":"I came to this town to take on a big assignment, but I can't do anything now with that bounty hunter hanging around."
