When you came close to some other splinters, the ones you had started pulsing and making a humming noise. As soon as you found the new splinters and put them together, they stopped. They all seem to have been part of the same crystal. You've collected enough of them now that you can puzzle together a symmetrical crystal but how do you fuse the parts together?",	"journal_entry_title":"Fragments of the past, III",	"task00_item_name":"Assemble crystal",	"task00_journal_entry_description":"You think you've found all the fragments of the crystal but how do you fuse them back together?
