We provide such a place in the heart of the forest; a place where one can call home. We are the Outcasts. You have been contacted because you are one of us; a brother or sister in need of like people. You can find us in the Webweaver Cave behind the Nawataa Waterfall. There, you'll be welcomed as one of our own from the very beginning. Welcome home.' -- Zhadran",	"task00_journal_entry_title":"The Outcasts"
