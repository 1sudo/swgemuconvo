It is like nothing we have ever seen before, amazing technology for something so old. Due to its incomprehensible thought matrix we were unable to perform a memory wipe. But one of our engineers came up with a solution, we were able to transfer the memory and thought patterns of the droid into a functioning sub-system of the crashed cruiser. Since we already striped the ship of everything of value, we should be safe from that homicidal droid there. On a side note our engineers said that in order to make the transfer they had to remove a sub-routine in the droid's thought patten...so sort of control override."
