All the ships systems seem to be off line but functional which have our engineers baffled as to the cause of the crash. The only occupant that we were able to find of the ship was a droid of unknown design. Surprisingly, after all this time, the droid seems to be in excellent condition and our engineers are confident that they will be able to reactivate it. Maybe it will have some clues about the origin of the vessel."
