Brok will not be harming any more innocents. Hopefully this will be enough to get Jabba off your back... and does the cargo Brok was so interested in have anything to do with all of this?",	"journal_entry_description":"Durr was a lackey. He might have been a good slicer, he was stupid for letting himself be seen as the front man of this operation. Brok used him as a road block to stop you. It's time to get to the bottom of all this. Brok is the nexus for this operation, and it's time he revealed his secrets.",	"journal_entry_title":"Face of Evil",	"task00_journal_entry_description":"Durr was a puppet and a fool. Brok is your target, and never has their been a more deserving mark made.",	"task00_journal_entry_title":"Fall of Evil",	"task01_comm_message_text":"You have served me well. I will not forget this.

You have worked off Jabba's debt and even managed to impress him in some small way. You have freed Mos Eisley of a terrible tyranny and kept this macabre information out of the hands of those that would profit from it. Not a bad start for you on Tatooine, Hero.",	"task02_journal_entry_title":"Complete"
