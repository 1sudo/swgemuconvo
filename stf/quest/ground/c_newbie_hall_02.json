This arrow moves and continually indicates the direction of your destination.  2. Waypoint in Datapad Your datapad is found in your Utilities Bar or by pressing CTRL D. In your datapad, under Waypoints you will find all saved waypoints. You can right click on them to bring up the radial menu. There you will find the option to Activate, Deactivate, or Destroy.

When you near your destination, you will see a glowing pillar of light that goes from the sky to the ground.
