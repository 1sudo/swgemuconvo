		"category":"Mustafar",	"journal_entry_description":"The only way for the Mustafarians to be safe is to destroy HK-47. Milo has intercepted a signal from the highest point in the area, a nearby volcano crater. It would seem that HK-47 is trying to flag down a ship and get offworld.",	"journal_entry_title":"Destroy HK-47",	"task00_journal_entry_description":"You need to find a pilot who is crazy enough to fly into the crater of an active volcano. There are not too many of those around but there has to be at least one on the planet.",	"task00_journal_entry_title":"Talk to a Pilot",	"task01_journal_entry_description":"You must destroy HK-47 before he has a chance to get away. He still has access to the droid factory and can start it up again any time he wants.",	"task01_journal_entry_title":"Defeat HK-47",	"task02_journal_entry_description":"You shouldn't have any more problem with HK-47. You should report your success to Milo.",	"task02_journal_entry_title":"Return to Milo",	"task03_journal_entry_description":"Milo has told you that you have a message waiting for you. He said that you could use the terminal located in this room to check the message.",	"task03_journal_entry_title":"Check Your Messages",	"task04_comm_message_text":"I must admit that you almost make me wish I still needed a good master...almost. Your little grey brain must be getting confused at this point...I understand that happens a lot with your kind. I didn't survive for four thousand years in the husk of a ship just to be destroyed by a few lucky shots. I must be going now. I have made a list, first I need to visit those Neimodians, then I think I will go after architects...don't worry you are far down the list. You amuse me. One last thing, I know that you meatbags like keepsakes...I have sent you one. You should start enjoying yourself, it won't take me long to get through my list."
