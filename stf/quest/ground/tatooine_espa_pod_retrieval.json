Watto will hold it until you have all the parts to rebuild the droid.",	"journal_entry_description":"Watto has told you a strange story about some crazy human that thought he could run the Boonta Eve Classic pod racer track years after its closure. He was warned about all the damage and buildings that have cropped up, but he tried it regardless.
