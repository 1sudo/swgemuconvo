Our engineers managed to turn the droid back on and it went on a rampage. It went through several of our engineers, three super battle droids, and even a droideka with incredible ease. Fortunately one of our smarter engineers installed a restraining bolt on it before we turned it back on and we were able to stop it. Viceroy Gunray has been informed of our discovery."
