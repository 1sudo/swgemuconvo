		"category":"Mustafar",	"journal_entry_description":"While looking through the stolen goods in the bandit camp, you received a message that must be over twenty years old. Most of the message was garbled, but it was from a Jedi Knight stationed on Mustafar during the Clone Wars. He mentioned a locked crate that he had kept some of his equipment in, which is being guarded by someone or something named Cobak.",	"journal_entry_title":"The Jedi's Guard Dog",	"task01_comm_message_text":"This will probably be my last entry. I managed to elude grey squad after they turned on me, but this morning I saw separatist vessels landing at the mining facility. It will only be a matter of time before either the droid or my own...correction, grey squad tracks me down. I have prepared for this event and stored most of my personal belongings in my travel chest. Cobak will watch over it and keep them safe. Hopefully, Master Yoda will find them and be able to figure out what is going on. Signing off.",	"task01_journal_entry_description":"You just received a message that must be at least twenty years old from a Jedi Knight serving during the Clone Wars.",	"task01_journal_entry_title":"A Message from the Past",	"task02_journal_entry_description":"The message was pretty old, but if Cobak is still alive maybe he knows where the Jedi's chest is. Find Cobak and see if you can get the chest from him. In his recording, the Jedi appeared to be located in Berken's Flow. Maybe that would be a good place to start your search.",	"task02_journal_entry_title":"Find Cobak",	"task03_journal_entry_description":"Cobak was apparently still standing guard over his master's chest after all these years. The chest appears to be undisturbed, but is locked with a code. Perhaps the numbers written on Cobak's collar, 78452, might help. ",	"task03_journal_entry_title":"Open the Chest"
