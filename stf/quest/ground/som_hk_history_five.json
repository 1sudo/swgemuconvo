He is awaiting word from Sideous before he can take the next step. The factory remains at the ready and if early estimates of its production capabilities are any indication, we will have a massive army of these new droids shortly after it is turned on. On a side note, the droids AI seems to have melded with the ship and taken over its operational systems. Our engineers have never seen the like before. We have sealed up the ship and disconnected the uplink we set up on the ship for reasons of safety. Once we have a chance we will destroy the ship and that homicidal AI with it."
