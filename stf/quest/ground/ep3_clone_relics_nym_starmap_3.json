The only survivor, almost unable to communicate after the attack, rambled on and on about witches of the night and giant spiders.'",	"task00_journal_entry_title":"A planet of death",	"task01_journal_entry_description":"You found what was probably the remains of the Imperial officer and the map was still intact on his corpse.
