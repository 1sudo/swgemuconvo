A lava beetle's blood is close in consistency and temperature to the lava flows where it makes its home. On death, the beetle's body bursts open, and the lava-like blood explodes everywhere. When this expulsed material cools, it occasionally forms into clear, smooth beads. These beads fetch a very high price on the open market.
