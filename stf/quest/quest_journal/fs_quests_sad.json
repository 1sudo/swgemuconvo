As you get closer to the tracking device (and thus the enemy), the radiation counter will go up.  If you move away, it goes down. 

The device will let you know if you're getting closer to the enemy or moving away from it.  The display will also indicate when you are within 64 meters of your target.

Keep the window up as you move, but look out for the enemy!",		"instructions_title":"Instructions",		"main_detail":"A variety of Shadow bases have been spotted in the surrounding countryside.  We suspect they are marshalling their forces for some sort of large-scale raid unlike anything we've seen.  If they were to strike now, we would be horribly unprepared.  We must convince them that we are much stronger than we, in fact, are.  Village agents are scouring the countryside as we speak looking for likely targets for dynamic raids.  We can use your help.",		"wrong_phase":"You did not complete your existing quest (Search and Destroy) in time.  You must restart that quest.",		"return8_detail":"Return to the NPC.",		"return7_detail":"Return to Dageerin, in the village.",		"return6_detail":"Return to Dageerin, in the village.",		"return5_detail":"Return to Dageerin, in the village.",		"return4_detail":"Return to Dageerin, in the village.",		"return3_detail":"Return to Dageerin, in the village.",		"return2_detail":"Return to Dageerin, in the village.",		"return1_detail":"Return to Dageerin, in the village.",		"return8":"Search And Destroy 8/8 - Return to village",		"return7":"Search And Destroy 7/8 - Return to village",		"return6":"Search And Destroy 6/8 - Return to village",		"return5":"Search And Destroy 5/8 - Return to village",		"return4":"Search And Destroy 4/8 - Return to village",		"return3":"Search And Destroy 3/8 - Return to village",		"return2":"Search And Destroy 2/8 - Return to village",		"return1":"Search And Destroy 1/8 - Return to village",		"task8_detail":"Exciting news!  We've finally tracked down one of their high-ranking officers.  Our efforts have flushed her out, and our agent caught a glimpse of her just a while back.  I think...well, better not say anything.  Be careful - a cornered rat fights hard.",		"task7_detail":"All of the reports coming in are promising - we definitely have them on the run now. 

 I think we're getting to their more elite troops - please be careful.

Note: Dageerin said to use the radiation sensor, found in your datapad, to track the tracking device planted on them.",		"task6_detail":"We may have turned the corner on this thing.  It feels great to finally take the battle to our enemy instead of waiting for them to attack.  

Ready for another one?",		"task5_detail":"Unfortunately, one of our field soldiers was caught and killed.  But he managed to get us a message with the coordinates of an enemy base.  Can you avenge him for us?

Can you help us again?",		"task1_detail":"We've spotted a number of enemy patrols in the area and could use your help.  

We know they're building their strength for a coming attack, and we'd like to strike while the iron is hot, so to speak.  Can you help us?
