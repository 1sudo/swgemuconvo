When properly reconfigured, the four indicators on the core's interface will light up.

To reconfigure the core, you will need to connect four wires in the proper order to contacts on the core. There are red wires, yellow wires, and blue wires.  Each color set of of wires connects to a different power source, and any combination of the wires may be used to reconfigure the computer core. 

When you have the wires configured the way you desire, you may test the configuration to see if it is correct. For each wire that is connected to the correct contact, one of the four indicators will be lit. If the correct type of wire is used but is connected to the wrong contact, then one of the indicators will flicker. You can use this feedback to determine the final configuration of the interface for the new computer core.

Be careful though... each time you test your configuration, power is sent through the core.  An incomplete configuration can damage the core. This is reported as 'Circuit Integrity' which gives the percentage chance that the core is still viable. Be sure to keep an eye on this value. On average, a core can survive 6 - 7 attempts without sigificant damage, but beyond that you risk frying the computer core's circuits and rendering it useless.",		"tracking_data_cancel_button":"Cancel",		"tracking_data_purchase_data":"Purchase Data",		"tracking_data_msg":"Would you like to purchase the rights to a fallen and abandoned satellite for purposes of salvage?
