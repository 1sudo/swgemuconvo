I now have more good news.  A pair of notorious thugs in the employ of Lady Valarian are scouring the area seeking our friend.  Find them and kill them.  I'll mark the location where our scanners last saw them.",	"bib_email_2":"You're proving to be more valuable than I'd imagined.  Good work with the thugs from Valarian.  Now find our friend.
