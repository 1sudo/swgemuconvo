		"cant_work":"Lady Valarian has scheduled a very important meeting. I must prepare for it. Come back when you're done with your other tasks and I may be able to help you.",	"dontknowyou_1":"That filthy crimeboss Lady Valarian has sent one of her thugs to destroy me. You'd better get out of here if you know what's good for you.",	"dontknowyou_2":"You better get out of here if you don't wanna die.",	"dontknowyou_3":"You're not the one Kavas told me about. Get out of here... or go to the Lucky Despot and drop a few credits. Tell Kavas I said hello.",	"dontknowyou_4":"You're not the one Kavas told me about. Get out of here... or go to the Lucky Despot and drop a few credits. Tell Kavas I said hello.",	"dontknowyou_5":"Who do you think you're talking to?",	"dontknowyou_6":"Get away from me, I'm busy.",	"gotowork_1":"",	"gotowork_2":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"gotowork_5":"",	"gotowork_6":"",	"next":"I appreciate your help. Why don't you ask Ind over there if he needs any help?",	"notit_1":"Thank you but... what is this? I can't use this. You may as well keep it for yourself.",	"notit_2":"",	"notit_3":"",	"notit_4":"Where's my package?  You don't have it?  What, did you lose it?",	"notit_5":"What?  What's this?",	"notit_6":"What's this?  This isn't what we asked for.",	"notyet":"Who are you? You look crafty enough but I have never heard of you. Come back when you have earned a reputation and I may be able to use your help.",	"npc_1_1":"I would guess that you're here to earn Lady Valarian's respect. This is a wise choice, my friend. Work for me first, and I will spread word of your courage and fidelity.",	"npc_1_2":"We have reliable information that Jabba the Hutt has sent a group of enforcers to patrol the edge of town and eliminate our operatives. Find them and destroy them.",	"npc_1_3":"Word of your deeds has spread. Many others in the Valarian organization are hearing of your deeds. Are you willing to do another favor for me?",	"npc_1_4":"You've made quite a name for yourself here at the despot.  For that you get to slide for a while.  Here, I just need somebody to pick something up for me.  That's it. ",	"npc_1_5":"Jabba sent a thug over to the Despot earlier, and he was harrassing some of our patrons.  I don't want any misunderstandings, I want this guy killed.",	"npc_1_6":"There's not much time for discussion.  Jabba sent an assassin to kill Lady Valarian, but he missed.  He did manage to grab most of our financial records though.  Get them back, at all costs!",	"npc_2_1":"Joyous! Our ex-friend Cie Vos has decided to liberate a case of rations from our stock. Punish him and bring the rations to me.",	"npc_2_2":"They'll most certainly be armed - and probably well-trained. So, be cautious.",	"npc_2_3":"Lady Valarian needs this revised proclamation to be delivered to her advocate just outside of town. He's an Ithorian... named Ysho... shouldn't be hard to find.",	"npc_2_4":"Great.  Go find my friend Ki'shai and get the package.  Make the delivery back to me and you'll get paid.",	"npc_2_5":"Good.  I knew I could count on you.  Take care of this and you won't be forgotten.",	"npc_2_6":"Good.  If you pull this one off I'll put in a good word for you myself.  I guarantee you'll move up for this.",	"npc_3_1":"You'll be back. Your kind always comes back.",	"npc_3_2":"Well, I hope none of our friends get killed.",	"npc_3_3":"A shame. Please come back when you have some time.",	"npc_3_4":"It's just a simple delivery.  What's you're problem?  Maybe you aren't as loyal as I thought.",	"npc_3_5":"You sure about that?  I'm not sure you want to say that right now.  You're on the cusp of greatness.  You're almost part of the family here.  You may want to think about this a bit.",	"npc_3_6":"I can't believe I had so much faith in you.  Why now, after all this time, do you finally show your true cowardice?",	"npc_4_1":"Lady Valarian cares. She can open doors for you, my friend.",	"npc_4_2":"That filthy slug has been trying to destroy our operation for a very long time. Fortunately, we are smarter and more skilled than Jabba's rank-and-file.",	"npc_4_3":"Our friends are hearing that you have great strength and courage... impeccable loyalty. All good things to have said about you, my friend. Will you help me again?",	"npc_4_4":"You'll find out.  Don't worry, it's nothing illegal.  I mean, not strictly anyway...",	"npc_4_5":"Respect.  You need it and you get it.  And also, cash.  You'll get some cash too.",	"npc_4_6":"",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_5_3":"",	"npc_5_4":"",	"npc_5_5":"",	"npc_5_6":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_6_3":"",	"npc_6_4":"",	"npc_6_5":"",	"npc_6_6":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Perhaps you should try looking just outside of town?",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Keep looking! Our friends are in danger. We can't have you dawdling!",	"npc_backtowork_3":"You're looking for Ysho, an Ithorian male... who should be waiting for you just outside of town. Please come back when you'e delivered the proclamation.",	"npc_backtowork_4":"Well don't keep me waiting.",	"npc_backtowork_5":"Don't waste time here.  I know he's not here!  Go find him.",	"npc_backtowork_6":"For the sake of your own life you better get back to work...",	"npc_breech_1":"Valarian sells POISON to her patrons! I stole this to prove it to the authorities! Please don't shoot me!",	"npc_breech_2":"There's a Valarian thug come to kill us. ATTACK!",	"npc_breech_3":"Nice work.  I thought I was going to be in real trouble.",	"npc_breech_4":"Ho! You better be that friend of Kavas' I was told to meet.",	"npc_breech_5":"You got something to say?  Say it with blood!",	"npc_breech_6":"You're all Valarian could find to send after me?  Hahahahaha!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"",	"npc_dropoff_3":"",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_dropoff_5":"",	"npc_dropoff_6":"",	"npc_failure_1":"You're not making such a good impression, my friend. You'll need to try harder if you are going to earn Lady Valarian's respect.",	"npc_failure_2":"Luckily one of our other friends has taken care of the Hutt enforcers. Thanks for nothing. Try to stay sharp the next time I give you something important to do.",	"npc_failure_3":"No! No! This will not do. This will simply not do at all!",	"npc_failure_4":"Couldn't make a simple delivery?  Is this the kind of reputation you want?",	"npc_failure_5":"You look bad.  I mean, not as bad as you made us look, but still...",	"npc_failure_6":"That's it, we're probably ruined now.  It'll take a miracle for us to stay on our feet after a debacle like this.  Good work.  Oh, in case you can't tell, that's sarcasm!",	"npc_more_1_1":"I don't TRUST you! Either you let me go or you kill me right here!",	"npc_more_1_2":"",	"npc_more_1_3":"Don't worry about it.  Just head back to the Despot and have a drink.",	"npc_more_1_4":"Kavas ordered an old-style camera as a gift for Ind. We mixed it in with a shipment of spice from Aeten II... and there was a whole mess... I don't have time to go into details.",	"npc_more_1_5":"",	"npc_more_1_6":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_2_4":"",	"npc_more_2_5":"",	"npc_more_2_6":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_more_3_4":"",	"npc_more_3_5":"",	"npc_more_3_6":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Actually - I believe I need to prepare the private suites downstairs for some visitors. Why don't you come back later when I have some more time?",	"npc_noloc_2":"Ind tells me that we've got some friends who've intercepted a group of Jabba's enforcers just outside the city. We'll see if these are the ones we're looking for. Come back and speak to me later today, please.",	"npc_noloc_3":"Now that I think about it - we should probably handle this differently. Please give me some time and come back in a little while. I need to sort things out.",	"npc_noloc_4":"Hang on, there may be trouble.  Come back and see me later, I have to work something out.",	"npc_noloc_5":"Well, some of our people were keeping an eye on this thug, and now he's vanished.  Come back later and I'll see if we can find him again.",	"npc_noloc_6":"I don't know where the assassin went, but if you come back in a few minutes I may have a better idea.",	"npc_reset":"Perhaps you should pay more attention next time. Take some notes perhaps. Ah, well.",	"npc_reward_1":"Ah, yes. The rations. Good job.",	"npc_reward_2":"Bravo! You've made this a safer place for legitimate businesspeople like us. Here is a small token of our gratitude. Don't spend it all in one place.",	"npc_reward_3":"I hear there was some trouble? You did quite well nonetheless. Thank you.",	"npc_reward_4":"Great!  Ind's gonna love it.  Thanks.  Here's some creds, don't spend em anywhere but the Despot, okay?  Haha.",	"npc_reward_5":"That's the way we handle things.  Jabba's steaming on his \"throne\" right now.  Good work.  Oh, by the way, Ind says she has some work for you, or if you want I have something else for you to do.",	"npc_reward_6":"You did it!  Valarian's so pleased she's told me to let you into the inner sanctum.  That means you'll be dealing with Ind from now on.  Treat her right, and you'll get the same in return.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"Ah, the proclamation.  I can't tell you how much easier this is going to make things for us.",	"npc_smuggle_4":"Here you go. The photo capture unit got smashed - but I think that Kavas knows how to fix it. See you around!",	"npc_smuggle_5":"",	"npc_smuggle_6":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"",	"npc_takeme_3":"",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_takeme_5":"",	"npc_takeme_6":"",	"npc_work_1":"Did you recover what I require?",	"npc_work_2":"Will you please take care of Jabba's Enforcers? They could be here at any moment!",	"npc_work_3":"Have you delivered the proclamation?",	"npc_work_4":"Hey, did you make that pick up for me?",	"npc_work_5":"How come I haven't heard about Jabba's thug dying yet?",	"npc_work_6":"Where's the briefcase?",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"",	"otherescort_3":"",	"otherescort_4":"",	"otherescort_5":"",	"otherescort_6":"",	"player_1_1":"Let's get started.",	"player_1_2":"Sounds like fun.",	"player_1_3":"Of course. What is it?",	"player_1_4":"Sure, no problem.",	"player_1_5":"I'm clear.  He's gone.",	"player_1_6":"I'm on my way.",	"player_2_1":"I can't help you right now.",	"player_2_2":"I can't do this right now.",	"player_2_3":"I'm not available at the moment.",	"player_2_4":"Sorry, I'm busy right now.",	"player_2_5":"This isn't my type of work.",	"player_2_6":"This is too much work.",	"player_3_1":"Who cares if you think I'm courageous?",	"player_3_2":"Why would Jabba do this?",	"player_3_3":"What are people hearing about me?",	"player_3_4":"What's this thing I'm picking up?",	"player_3_5":"What's the payout on this?",	"player_3_6":"",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"",	"player_4_3":"",	"player_4_4":"",	"player_4_5":"",	"player_4_6":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"",	"player_5_3":"",	"player_5_4":"",	"player_5_5":"",	"player_5_6":"",	"player_more_1_1":"What are you talking about?",	"player_more_1_2":"",	"player_more_1_3":"What is this proclamation for?",	"player_more_1_4":"What is this thing I'm supposed to retrieve?",	"player_more_1_5":"",	"player_more_1_6":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_2_3":"",	"player_more_2_4":"",	"player_more_2_5":"",	"player_more_2_6":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_more_3_3":"",	"player_more_3_4":"",	"player_more_3_5":"",	"player_more_3_6":"",	"player_reset":"I couldn't find the target.",	"player_sorry":"I am still looking for my target.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"Return the rations to Kavas Urdano at the Lucky Despot",	"return_waypoint_description_2":"Return to the Lucky Despot to receive your reward.",	"return_waypoint_description_3":"Return to the Lucky Despot to receive your reward.",	"return_waypoint_description_4":"Return to the Lucky Despot to receive your reward.",	"return_waypoint_description_5":"Return back to the Lucky Despot and speak to Kavas.",	"return_waypoint_description_6":"Return to the Lucky Despot and speak with Kavas.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Lucky Despot",	"return_waypoint_name_2":"Lucky Despot",	"return_waypoint_name_3":"Lucky Despot",	"return_waypoint_name_4":"Lucky Despot",	"return_waypoint_name_5":"Lucky Despot",	"return_waypoint_name_6":"Lucky Despot",	"waypoint_description_1":"Eliminate the thief \"Cie Vos\" and return the rations to Kavas Urdano at the Lucky Despot",	"waypoint_description_2":"Destroy Jabba's Enforcers who've been sent to kill Lady Valarian",	"waypoint_description_3":"Find Ysho and deliver the prolcamation.",	"waypoint_description_4":"Find Ki'shai and recover Kava's gift for Ind.",	"waypoint_description_5":"Jabba's enforcer must be taught a lesson.",	"waypoint_description_6":"Jabba's assassin missed Lady Valarian, but stole important financial documents.
