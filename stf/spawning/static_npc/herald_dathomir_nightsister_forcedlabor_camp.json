Then maybe you might be able to help! The Nightsisters chose the strongest of their slaves and force them to work the mines! I managed to escape and search for help, for we cannot save ourselves! Will you please help us gain our freedom?",	"npc_2_1":"Oh, thank you! Here is where the mines are. We're trapped down deep inside the mines, and the Nightsisters oversee everything we do. If you're going to help us, you will need to bring help of your own. I look forward to seeing my friends again! thank you so much.",	"npc_3_1":"I guess I understand. The Nightsisters are something no one should have to face in a battle. I will be off to try to find someone who is able to help.",	"npc_4_1":"They were the first people I sought out. The Empire told me that they would prefer to leave well enough alone, and that they didn't care about a few escaped slaves. Blast the Empire! They are no better than the Nightsisters!
