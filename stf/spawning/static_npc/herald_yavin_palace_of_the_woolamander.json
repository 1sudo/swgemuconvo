I am conducting a survey of the local wildlife in the area, but have sprained my ankle. I won't be able to continue my studies, and all I had left was one last place the locals call the Palace of the Woolamander. Perhaps you may be interested in going there for me?",	"npc_2_1":"Oh, thank you. I was told it is located a little ways off. Here, let me mark it in your datapad. All I'm interested in knowing is if this place does indeed contain woolamanders as the stories say. If so, take studies of their sizes and what differences the local resources have on their physiology. Once you have about 3 years of notes, please come back to me.",	"npc_3_1":"Well, I've always said that the life of a xeno-biologist isn't for everyone! If you find any other brave xeno-biologists on your journeys, please direct them to me. Thank you.",	"npc_4_1":"Why, because there are supposedly an extraordinary amount of woolamanders that live there. It seems that when the temple was first found, instead of finding the builders of the structure, the locals found a den thriving with the creatures. Stories go on to say that the place is rich in resources, thus allowing these creatures to breed at alarming rates.",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Oh, thank you.
