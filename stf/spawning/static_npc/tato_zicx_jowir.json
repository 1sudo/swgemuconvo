		"cant_work":"Sorry. I'm a bit busy right now. You look pretty busy, too. Why don't you come back later? Thanks.",	"dontknowyou_1":"Get out of here!",	"gotowork_1":"",	"next":"I can't keep giving out Zicx. They're rare. Did you know they are impossible to destroy? It's mind-boggling... but true. Good day.",	"notit_1":"Like I said... I don't do business with anyone who wanders in out of the sand. If you're not on official business from Jabba the Hutt - and if you're not a friend of a friend, I don't want to waste my time with you.",	"notyet":"Who are you? I don't do business with just anyone. You need a voucher... or a buy order from Jabba himself! Goodbye.",	"npc_1_1":"So Goru sent you to me? To get your hands on some Zicx bugs, right? That's fine. Goru is a good friend. What would you say if I asked you to do me a small favor first?",	"npc_2_1":"Great! One of Valarian's thugs knocked off a recent delivery to Jabba's Palace. A specially processed jar of spice. Return it to me and I will give you a hearty measure of Zicx bugs from my private collection.",	"npc_3_1":"Well, if you see Goru again - tell him he still owes me twelve thousand credits for that stunt he pulled on Rori. (I wonder if he ever got off that rock?)",	"npc_4_1":"Goru probably told you that I'm in the spice business. I've used my skills as a biologist to create a spice refinement method that is... astounding! Unfortunately, some of my samples have been stolen. I would like them returned to me.",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"They should be just outside of town. Thrash them and retrieve my spice and I will give you a jar of fresh young Zicx that you can take back to Goru.",	"npc_breech_1":"The spice is MINE! Stay away or we'll destroy you!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_failure_1":"Valarian's thugs made off with my spice. You failed me.",	"npc_more_1_1":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Actually... you might want to come back and see me later on. There is something that I need to do at the moment.",	"npc_reset":"Fine. Why don't you come back later? Thanks.",	"npc_reward_1":"Thank you for retrieving the spice. Take this jar of young Zicx... and be very careful if and when you decide to approach the Sarlacc. In fact, you might want to see my friend Palu on the other side of town... she may have something you can use.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_work_1":"Did you find Valarian's thieves?",	"otherescort_1":"",	"player_1_1":"I don't mind. Just tell me what you want and I'll be happy to help.",	"player_2_1":"Actually, I'm not interested in doing any favors for you.",	"player_3_1":"What sort of favor?",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_more_1_1":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_reset":"I can't do this anymore.",	"player_sorry":"Not yet. I am still looking for them.",	"return_waypoint_description_1":"Return the spice to Jowir Ar'Lensa to retrieve your reward.",	"return_waypoint_name_1":"Jowir Ar'Lensa",	"waypoint_description_1":"Some of Valarian's thieves have stolen specially prepared spice. Jowir needs this spice returned to him. In exchange, he will give you a jar of Zicx bugs for use in a special weapon.",	"waypoint_name_1":"Valarian Thieves"
