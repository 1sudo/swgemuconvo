		"cant_work":"We can't talk right now. Lady Valarian suspects that there is a spy in our midst. You should take care of your personal business and come back later.",	"dontknowyou_1":"Look. I'm waiting for someone. You'd better not be seen with me. I have the death sentence on twelve systems!",	"dontknowyou_2":"I have no idea what you're talking about.",	"dontknowyou_3":"Who are you?  Sorry, I'm rather distracted at the moment...",	"dontknowyou_4":"Get away from me.  I'm dangerous",	"dontknowyou_5":"You don't want any part of me.",	"dontknowyou_6":"I'm very busy and very important.  I can't talk to you.",	"gotowork_1":"Are you kidding? I'm here for the new roster. Not THAT!",	"gotowork_2":"",	"gotowork_3":"",	"gotowork_4":"",	"gotowork_5":"",	"gotowork_6":"",	"next":"Sorry I can't help you. I have a number of new recruits to train. Why don't you speak with Lady Valarian?",	"notit_1":"",	"notit_2":"",	"notit_3":"What is this?",	"notit_4":"What is this?",	"notit_5":"I'm not sure what that is.",	"notit_6":"This isn't the egg.  What is this?",	"notyet":"You should chat with Kavas over there. She's got plenty of work for folks like you.",	"npc_1_1":"Kavas says you're ready to do some real work. I've put your name on a list of new recruits. Deliver it to our chief assassin to avoid getting murdered in the street.",	"npc_1_2":"Lady Valarian's compound guard was supposed to deliver lunch some time ago. We haven't heard anything and we're starting to worry. Can you go check it out?",	"npc_1_3":"Rumor has it Jabba hired an off world scientist named Dr. Kaum to come help him develop some weapons technology.  Dr. Kaum doesn't know any of Jabba's thugs, so go pick him up before they get there.",	"npc_1_4":"There's a murderer on the loose.  Never let it be said that we let something like this happen in our territory.  I want this one killed.  Are we clear?",	"npc_1_5":"Jabba's trying to be clever.  He sent someone to taint our water supplies.  Find the one's responsible and bring back whatever they're putting in our water.",	"npc_1_6":"This is it.  This one will get you in to see Valarian herself.  She wants you to steal an expensive avian egg from a delivery guy.",	"npc_2_1":"Good choice. Here's the updated ledger. You'll find our Chief Assassin on the outskirts of town.",	"npc_2_2":"Excellent. Head out toward the edge of town and see if you can escort our friend here.",	"npc_2_3":"Great.  When you get him back here we'll take *good* care of him.",	"npc_2_4":"Right.  Murder will not be tolerated.  Not of innocents.  If this guy were killing Jabba's people, who would notice?",	"npc_2_5":"I knew I could count on you.  There's likely to be more than one of them.  Get them all if you can.",	"npc_2_6":"I had a feeling.  Anyone that's hung around here as long as you certainly wants to see the boss lady.",	"npc_3_1":"That's what I thought. ",	"npc_3_2":"Unwise. Lady Valarian expects loyalty. I'll try to keep your unwillingness a secret.",	"npc_3_3":"Yeah, you're right.  Maybe whoever we hire to take your place...",	"npc_3_4":"You sound more cowardly then you used to.  Are you feeling all right?",	"npc_3_5":"We don't have a lot of time on this one so come back as soon as you're free.",	"npc_3_6":"Well, don't keep the boss waiting, she doesn't like it.",	"npc_4_1":"Never you mind. If you are not known to our chief assassin you will surely die...",	"npc_4_2":"Lady Valarian ordered a special Rill casserole. I'm sure she'd share it if it arrives safely.",	"npc_4_3":"Just tell him Jabba wants to meet him for a drink first.  This guy doesn't know anything about what's going on here.  We're gonna make sure he knows the score.",	"npc_4_4":"Killers aren't good business.  Who's gonna gamble if everyone's dead?  Who's gonna pay for protection.  This one has to be taken care of.",	"npc_4_5":"I don't know yet.  That's why I need you to bring it back.  Lots of our customers are getting sick, whatever this stuff is.",	"npc_4_6":"That's the joke.  Jabba ordered it special.  His chef, Porcellus, was going to make him a special meal.  We're gonna annoy Jabba and have a nice dinner all at the same time!",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_5_2":"",	"npc_5_3":"No one seems to know, though from what I hear Dr. Kaum's specialty is beam weapons.  Probably just some new kind of rifle.",	"npc_5_4":"Someone called Roden Venthrall.  A student, apparently, of Dolac Legasi's.",	"npc_5_5":"You know what our number one selling drink is at the Despot?  Water.  It's a desert friend, everybody needs water!",	"npc_5_6":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_6_2":"",	"npc_6_3":"You should have plenty of lead time, but even if you don't I know you know how to fight...",	"npc_6_4":"Heh, another murderer serving a life sentence in an imperial prison on Dathomir.  You don't want to run into that guy, trust me.",	"npc_6_5":"Positive.  We spotted a couple of them near our moisture harvesters.  Don't get careless, these guys are for real.",	"npc_6_6":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Good luck.",	"npc_backtowork_2":"Please hurry.",	"npc_backtowork_3":"Get out there before Jabba's fiends find him.",	"npc_backtowork_4":"Get out there and find that guy!",	"npc_backtowork_5":"Get out there and find these guys, we're going out of business here!",	"npc_backtowork_6":"Get it before it goes bad.  Do you know how bad those things smell when they're ripe?",	"npc_breech_1":"Over here! You're the new one, eh?",	"npc_breech_2":"Great!  I'm glad somebody finally figured out that I needed help!",	"npc_breech_3":"I'm looking for an escort to, uh...Mr. The Hutt's palace?",	"npc_breech_4":"I'll kill you too!",	"npc_breech_5":"Heh, something else we can foul up besides water.  Get him boys!",	"npc_breech_6":"NO!  Do you know who this egg is for?  Bodyguards!  Save me!",	"npc_dropoff_1":"",	"npc_dropoff_2":"Thanks for the safe trip!",	"npc_dropoff_3":"Oh, thank you for bringing me safely to the city.",	"npc_dropoff_4":"",	"npc_dropoff_5":"",	"npc_dropoff_6":"",	"npc_failure_1":"How could you have failed to deliver a list of NAMES?",	"npc_failure_2":"Lady Valarian does not tolerate skipping lunch!",	"npc_failure_3":"You let him get away?!?  Great.  I thought you were more competent than this...",	"npc_failure_4":"That guy's gonna go on a killing spree.  You should be ashamed.",	"npc_failure_5":"Great, we're ruined.  All thanks to you.",	"npc_failure_6":"Jabba got his egg?  I can't believe this!",	"npc_more_1_1":"No. You have too little blood on your hands. Keep trying, though. See if Ind has more work for you.",	"npc_more_1_2":"These guys wouldn't let me get back to work.  I'm glad you came along.",	"npc_more_1_3":"Oh, well, that's fine then.  I hope they have blue milk....",	"npc_more_1_4":"",	"npc_more_1_5":"",	"npc_more_1_6":"",	"npc_more_2_1":"",	"npc_more_2_2":"",	"npc_more_2_3":"",	"npc_more_2_4":"",	"npc_more_2_5":"",	"npc_more_2_6":"",	"npc_more_3_1":"",	"npc_more_3_2":"",	"npc_more_3_3":"",	"npc_more_3_4":"",	"npc_more_3_5":"",	"npc_more_3_6":"",	"npc_noloc_1":"Wait a minute. I think our Chief Assassin is off-world today. Why don't you come back in a few cycles?",	"npc_noloc_2":"Actually - if I remember correctly Kavas said she got a message from the compound guard a few moments ago. Perhaps all is well. Check back with me later.",	"npc_noloc_3":"Hm...it seems the good doctor hasn't arrived yet.  Come back in a few minutes and I'll keep you posted.",	"npc_noloc_4":"When I get a fix on this guy's location I'll let you know.  Actually, just come back later and I'll tell you what's going on.",	"npc_noloc_5":"If you ask me again in a few minutes we should be able to figure out exactly where these guys are.",	"npc_noloc_6":"Wait a sec...you'll have to come back in a few and I'll tell you where the delivery guy is.",	"npc_reset_1":"You're in too deep now, my friend.",	"npc_reward_1":"Good to have you on the team. Lady Valarian wants all of her new recruits to use these fresh Republic Blasters. So here you go. Be careful with it...",	"npc_reward_2":"Perfect, Jabba will be furious! Here, you've earned every last one of these credits.",	"npc_reward_3":"Great.  Now that he's here we'll make sure he's working for the right team.  Here's some cash to help you along, oh, and we found this on the good doctor.  You can have it too.",	"npc_reward_4":"I can't tell you how happy I am that this is taken care of.  Our loyal customers have nothing but good things to say about you.",	"npc_reward_5":"Excellent work once again.  Valarian's been talking about you lately.  I think she'll invite you to see her soon.",	"npc_reward_6":"You got it!  Great.  Valarian's ready to see you.",	"npc_smuggle_1":"Aah. Welcome to the Valarian family.",	"npc_smuggle_2":"",	"npc_smuggle_3":"",	"npc_smuggle_4":"",	"npc_smuggle_5":"",	"npc_smuggle_6":"",	"npc_takeme_1":"",	"npc_takeme_2":"Ok, I'm ready to head back to the Despot.",	"npc_takeme_3":"Where are we going?",	"npc_takeme_4":"",	"npc_takeme_5":"",	"npc_takeme_6":"",	"npc_work_1":"Are you done already?",	"npc_work_2":"Why haven't you found Valarian's compound guard?",	"npc_work_3":"Where's the scientist?",	"npc_work_4":"Did you take care of that little problem we were having?",	"npc_work_5":"Did you take care of our little problem?",	"npc_work_6":"Where's the egg?",	"otherescort_1":"",	"otherescort_2":"I'm waiting for somebody, and guess what?  It's not you!",	"otherescort_3":"I'm waiting for someone, sorry, I can't talk.",	"otherescort_4":"",	"otherescort_5":"",	"otherescort_6":"",	"player_1_1":"Sounds good. Sign me up.",	"player_1_2":"I would be happy to.",	"player_1_3":"Ok, I'll go get him.",	"player_1_4":"Got it.  Kill the killer.",	"player_1_5":"I'll get right to it.",	"player_1_6":"I'll do it.  I've been waiting for this...",	"player_2_1":"I am not ready yet.",	"player_2_2":"I can't do this right now.",	"player_2_3":"This sounds like something someone else could do.",	"player_2_4":"This sounds dangerous.",	"player_2_5":"I'm a little busy.",	"player_2_6":"I'll have to come back later.",	"player_3_1":"Who is this assassin?",	"player_3_2":"What's for lunch?",	"player_3_3":"Won't he realize I'm not taking him to Jabba's?",	"player_3_4":"Why don't we just hire this murderer?",	"player_3_5":"What are they putting in the water?",	"player_3_6":"Where is it being delivered to?",	"player_4_1":"",	"player_4_2":"",	"player_4_3":"What kind of weapon are they building?",	"player_4_4":"Who is this killer.",	"player_4_5":"Why the water supply?",	"player_4_6":"",	"player_5_1":"",	"player_5_2":"",	"player_5_3":"What if Jabba's guys show up?",	"player_5_4":"Who's Dolac Legasi?",	"player_5_5":"You're sure it's Jabba's guys?",	"player_5_6":"",	"player_more_1_1":"Am I really a member of the family now?",	"player_more_1_2":"What happened out here?",	"player_more_1_3":"Uh...Jabba wants to have a drink with you.",	"player_more_1_4":"",	"player_more_1_5":"",	"player_more_1_6":"",	"player_more_2_1":"",	"player_more_2_2":"",	"player_more_2_3":"",	"player_more_2_4":"",	"player_more_2_5":"",	"player_more_2_6":"",	"player_more_3_1":"",	"player_more_3_2":"",	"player_more_3_3":"",	"player_more_3_4":"",	"player_more_3_5":"",	"player_more_3_6":"",	"player_reset_1":"I don't want to do this anymore.",	"player_sorry_1":"My mistake.
