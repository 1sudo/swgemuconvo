I'm just about ready to leave this planet, so I've got a hot tip for you. There's a bunch of Marauders who didn't listen to their mommy and daddy or whatever they have for parents. Well, they done left their citadel and decided to set up a new home. Basically, they're ripe for the hunting, if you can see what I mean? Wanna know where?",	"npc_2_1":"You've got the right attitude for this planet! Okay, let me show you where they ran off to. I'm pretty certain they probably brought some weapons with them, so it won't be as easy as shooting them one by one. Then again, I don't think I need to tell you that. Good luck, and make sure you save some for me for when I get back.",	"npc_3_1":"Well, if you're not a Bounty Hunter, I don't know what you're doing on this planet. There's nothing of interest except for all the indigenous wildlife. Whatever.",	"npc_4_1":"I've come here to add to my pelt collection. What else do you think I'm here for? My health? This moon is dangerous! If it weren't so much fun hunting down those Ewoks, I'd find some other planet to work on my skills. I'm leaving for home, so do you want the tip or not?",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"You've got the right attitude for this planet! Okay, let me show you where they ran off to.
