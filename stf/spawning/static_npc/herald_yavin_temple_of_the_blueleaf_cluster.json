You might be asking yourself why someone like me would be here on a planet like this, aren't you? Well, I am a representative of Star Tours, a travel agency known Galaxy-wide. We're conducting surveys on possible future business expansions. Hey! Perhaps you might be able to help? Would you be interested in helping us?",	"npc_2_1":"Spectacular! All we need is for you to go to this building and explore the area. We'll ask other passerbys if they'll do the same for us as well. Just get a feel of the place, and ask yourself \"Is this the type of place I would bring my family on vacation\". We'll eventually meet up again and I'll then ask you what your opinion of the place is.",	"npc_3_1":"Ah, what a shame. To think I had a couple of tickets that I was thinking of giving away for our new cruiseliner, the Tzarina. Well, tickets for whenever it gets back from it's voyage. Well, ta-ta!",	"npc_4_1":"Well, if you're familiar with us, you'll know that we sell exciting tours across the galaxy. We're looking into offering a new way of exploring the galaxy that we call home, in what we call a \"safari\". One of the highlights will be to show off indigenous structures to explore, all safely of course.",	"npc_5_1":"",	"npc_6_1":"",	"npc_backtowork_1":"Good!
