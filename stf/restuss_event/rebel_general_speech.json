		"speech_1":"Alright, attention everyone! New intel has just arrived that forces us to act immediately.",	"speech_2":"The Imperial scientists have almost finished their new power source and we can't stand idly by anymore. We are planning an all out assault but have a problem.",	"speech_3":"The Empire has shipped in several armored walkers to defend the line at this critical moment and they are stalling us.",	"speech_4":"We need to destroy them to be able to break through the defenses and that is where you come in. We are counting on you to be the spearhead that cuts our way through the Imperial line.",	"speech_5":"I don't think I have to tell you what is at stake here. If the scientists complete that power core, we may have already lost this war.",	"speech_6":"The fate of the men, women and children around the galaxy lies in your hands, don't let them down! For the Alliance!"
