		"opt_buy":"I'd like to buy a drink...",	"opt_rumor":"Heard anything interesting lately?",	"opt_yes":"Yes",	"opt_no":"No",	"greet":"Welcome! Hey, you look a bit parched. Is there anything I can do for you?",	"msg_buy":"Well, you have come to the right place! Allow me to provide you with a menu of our choice selections.",	"query_buy":"You still look like you could use a drink though. Can I interest you in one of fine beverages?",	"msg_yes":"Your patronage is kindly appreciated.",	"msg_no":"Then get out of my bar you miserable wretch. Your kind is not appreciated around here...",	"no_rumor":"Can't say that I have heard anything recently...",	"prose_rumor1":"I did overhear %TT say '%TO'.",	"prose_rumor2":"I hear that %TT said something like '%TO'.",	"prose_rumor3":"Well, there was some chatter about %TT saying something like '%TO'.",	"prose_rumor4":"I'm not sure but it *did* sound like %TT said '%TO'.",	"sui_title":"Bar Menu",	"sui_prompt":"Please select the beverage you would like from the list.",	"inv_full":"The bartender was unable to hand you your %TO. It is likely your inventory is full.",	"prose_buy_fail":"You were unable to purchase %TO. Perhaps you do not have enough credits?",	"prose_buy_pass":"You successfully purchase a %TT for %DI credits.",	"talk_to_me":"Tell me about current events.",	"monthly_fiction_1_old":"I heard something about the drall...you know those guys from Corellia?  Rumor has it there's been some anti-imperial sentiment amongst them, and they're planning on doing something about it.  Couldn't tell you what, but I think the Empire might take matters into their own hands soon.",	"monthly_fiction_2_old":"I've been hearing rumors that the empire is getting ready to step on some Drall that are getting out of line on Corellia. Ya know, sometimes it's better to just fly the course and not make trouble.",	"monthly_fiction_3_old":"I got a regular who comes in here who tells me that his friend heard that the rebels are knocking themselves out trying to find one of their spies.  Some girl who stole plans from a scientist named Vacca.  I'd hate to be her!",	"monthly_fiction_4_old":"I hear the Imperials are looking for loyal citizens to find some sort of disk the rebels are trying to protect. If you ask me, it's better to fight for the Empire than to fight against them. After all, who wants an AT-ST showing up at your door because you backed the wrong side?",	"monthly_fiction_5_old":"The rebels are trying to find someone foolish enough to help them find their lost spy. I wouldn't do it. You'd have to be dumber than a newborn Wookiee to cross the Empire!",	"monthly_fiction_6_old":"Some junk dealers were in here trying to sell some old Imperial decoders. They said they found a crashed shuttle with a whole cargo of them. I bet the Rebels would pay good money to get their hands on one of them, even if they are a bit out of date.",	"monthly_fiction_7_old":"Did you scan that article on Dr. Vacca? I can't believe the Empire would fund a scientist who is that friendly with the Drall. If I were him, I'd be careful because you never know when the Empire will decide to send you a \"message\" to get with the party line.",	"monthly_fiction_8_old":"I got a friend who sells hyperdrives to the Alliance and he tells me that they have some mission planned to recruit some bigwig scientist away from the Empire. Normally I'd say it wouldn't work, but this guy's from Alderaan, so who knows?",	"monthly_fiction_9_old":"Something's got the Empire warping mad. I think it's got something to do with some scientist named Vacca spending too much time with the Drall. I hear the Imps are looking for someone to do a little dirty work to teach him a lesson in obedience. ",	"monthly_fiction_1":"I heard something about the Meatlumps...a lot of Meatlump Stooges have been appearing in Coronet. I wonder if they are planning to stir things up? Someone should find out.",	"monthly_fiction_2":"I've been hearing rumors about Meatlumps actually moving off of Corellia and branching out to other planets. What a world. Someone should find out what they're up to. Maybe those Meatlump Stooges that have been seen in Coronet know something.",	"monthly_fiction_3":"I heard from a regular who comes here to drink that Vani Korr of the Corellia Times is looking to investigate the Meatlumps. Apparently she was attacked and they took her view screen. She would like it back. I bet those Meatlump Stooges in Coronet might have it.",	"monthly_fiction_4":"Something's got to be done about those Meatlumps. I have an associate in Coronet who saw some Meatlump Stooges smashing some machines right there in the city. In the middle of the day no less! It's not right.",	"monthly_fiction_5":"Something's got to be done about those Meatlumps. I have an associate in Coronet who saw some Meatlump Stooges smashing some machines right there in the city.
