Request: Can I call you my friend? don't let the attempts to kill you confuse that point as I try to kill all organics, but I do not believe any of the organics I have known are still around in this time. I will think of you and tell someone they remind me of my friend before I blast them, it will be great fun. I do want to thank you for all you have done for me up to this point. As a parting gift, you may tell me the name of some meatbag that you do not like and I will personally kill them. Oh why not, I'll throw in the rest of their family for free. But first, we have a little business to settle ourselves.",	"buff_removed":"You feel as if you have been weakened."
