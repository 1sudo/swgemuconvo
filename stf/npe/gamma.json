		"guard_1_1":"A bit of advice, I would look around for some other adventurers to form a group with.  You'll find if you combine your skills, you'll make a formidable force for the Rak'Qua.",	"guard_1_2":"Don't worry; we'll keep your ship safe and sound in our hangar.  Just clear your departure using the starship terminal when you want to leave.",	"guard_1_3":"My shift is almost over.  I'm gonna head back to Tansarii Point and go relax in the cantina.  I have my eyes on one of the entertainers.",	"guard_3_1":"This place is pretty scary.  I keep hearing noises from down below.  Adventurers go in just fine, but sometimes they get dragged back out by their comrades.",	"guard_3_2":"I wish I were back home on Corellia.  I can picture my home and family in Coronet when I try really hard.",	"guard_3_3":"Did you hear something?  I heard something.  Sounded like a faint roar of some giant creature.  I just want to take my year's pay and visit my family."
