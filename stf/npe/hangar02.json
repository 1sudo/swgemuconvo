		"visitor_1_1":"I agree with the guard.  This...thing is a piece of junk.  I doubt it will ever make it off this station.  Look at the sparks! HA HA!",	"visitor_1_2":"I came to Tansarii station to get a much needed break from my hometown on Lok.  There is a lot of fun to be had here if you talk to the right people.",	"visitor_1_3":"Who knew it would take so long to get from Lok to Ord Mantell?  I'm going to swing by the cantina and grab a drink.  I hear they have an excellent band in there now.  They're doing a cover of a popular song from Tatooine."
