		"patient_1_1":"Station Gamma is dangerous.  Full of thugs and droids who have gone crazy.  That is how I ended up here.",	"patient_1_2":"Next time I go to Gamma Station, I'm going to try and get myself a group of friends. It's no fun to wander around that place alone.",	"patient_1_3":"Watch out for the travel guide over by Hangar 01.  He is a scam artist. He took my money and ran.",	"patient_2_1":"All those promising young Imperial officers...gone.  Why would the Rebel terrorists destroy the Empire's peacekeeping station?",	"patient_2_2":"I hope the Empire finds those rebel scum soon.  All this disruption throughout the Galaxy is getting on my nerves.",	"patient_2_3":"My cousin just enlisted in the Imperial Navy.  He is learning to fly a TIE Fighter.  I wish I were a pilot.  I'd love to blow away some Rebel ships.",	"patient_3_3":"I'm sure that any day now an important Rebel general will send me the coordinates of their hiding place.  Strange that they left me here... I'm invaluable to them, due to my skills.",	"patient_3_2":"I'm not afraid of Darth Vader.  I don't really believe in the 'Force' and all that.  I always found a nice vibroblade to be much more useful.",	"patient_3_1":"Did you hear that the Rebels destroyed the Death Star?  Yeah, I was there.  I fired the shot that blew it all up. It was all me.",	"doctor_1_1":"The upper and lower levels are dangerous on this station.  They have become infested with Hutt thugs and voracious beasts.",	"doctor_1_2":"If you ask me, Inaldra is losing control of this station.  Every day it seems like we get more and more hurt workers coming in.",	"doctor_1_3":"I don't have much time to talk.  I have to heal these patients.  Too bad there aren't more medics around.  If these people had a medic in their group, they might not be here."
