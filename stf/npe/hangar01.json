		"pilot_1_1":"Have you ever flown a starship through an asteroid field?  Neither have I -- only insane pilots would try such a stunt.",	"pilot_1_2":"The life of a pilot is pretty good around here.  With all the pirates and Hutts flying around, the station pays well for our services.",	"pilot_1_3":"It's easy to get lost out in space around here.  The other day I was too busy gazing at the nebulas to watch where I was going.  Next thing I knew, I was lost.  Good thing I had that 'hyperspace back to station' program installed on my navicomputer.",	"pilot_2_1":"I don't know about you, but I try and stay neutral in this Galactic Civil War.  I want as few enemies shooting at me as possible.",	"pilot_2_2":"I don't envy the Rebels at all.  I hear Darth Vader has been personally sent to find and eliminate them.",	"pilot_2_3":"I'm a Privateer pilot.  That means that I am neutral in all this Civil War business.  It gives me freedoms I might not have if I enlisted with the Empire or the Rebels.",	"pilot_3_1":"I just put a new set of wings on my ship.   They look great and make flight so much smoother. I just used the starship terminal to change my components around until I found the right parts.",	"pilot_3_2":"If you ever get into a dogfight in space, I highly recommend Ion Cannons.  They tear through shields like a vibroblade through armor.",	"pilot_3_3":"Upgrading my ship with the loot I get off pirates is a hobby of mine.  My friends and I meet sometimes to show off our new stuff."
