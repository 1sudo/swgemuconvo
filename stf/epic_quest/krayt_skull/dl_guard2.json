		"npc_1":"We're not letting anyone in until the boss gets what he wants.",	"player_1":"What is it that he wants?",	"player_2":"Know any rumors?",	"npc_2":"He's looking for a Tusken rifle.  Some antique owned by the first king of the Tuskens or something.",	"npc_3":"Some thieves were arrested in Bestine the other day, claimed to be employees of Borvo the Hutt's.  You know Borvo?",	"player_3":"Why does Huff want this rifle?",	"player_4":"Where was the rifle?",	"npc_4":"It's an antique.  I think he wants it as an heirloom to hand down to one of his kids.",	"npc_5":"It was stolen in a shipment that was on its way to Tatooine.  That's about all I know.",	"player_5":"Don't know Borvo.",	"player_6":"He's a Hutt?",	"npc_6":"He's a gangster.  Lives on Naboo, I hear, though no one seems to know where.  I would guess the swamps myself.",	"npc_7":"Just like Jabba.  I hear he and Jabba are friends.  They're always exchanging gifts from what I hear.  I think it's a Hutt thing.",	"npc_8":"Did you bring the rifle?",	"player_7":"Yeah, I got it.",	"player_8":"I'm not ready to give it up yet.",	"npc_9":"Go on in then, and talk to Huff.
