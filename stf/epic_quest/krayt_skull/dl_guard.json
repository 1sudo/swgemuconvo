		"npc_1":"Sorry, Huff's not seeing anyone today.  You'll have to move along.",	"player_1":"How come he's not seeing anyone?",	"player_2":"Who is Huff?",	"npc_2":"He's very upset about a Tusken Rifle.  It was an antique, and someone's taken it off the planet.  He wants to get it back, but isn't sure how to go about it.",	"npc_3":"Huff Darklighter?  The head of the Darklighter estate?  He's only the biggest business magnate on Tatooine.  Where have you been?",	"player_3":"Where have you looked for the rifle?",	"player_4":"What do you know about the rifle?",	"npc_4":"We've checked everywhere on Tatooine.  Huff tried some of his contacts on Corellia but they were no help.  Personally I think it's on Naboo.",	"npc_5":"I hear some criminals got hold of it.  The criminal element has lots to do with these things, when stuff disappears you know?",	"player_5":"Don't know him.",	"player_6":"Oh, that guy.",	"npc_6":"Well, I suggest you take your head out of the sand and look around you.",	"npc_7":"Yeah, that guy.  Get it together.  You won't survive long on Tatooine if you can't keep up.",	"npc_8":"Did you bring the rifle?",	"player_7":"Yeah, I got it.",	"player_8":"I'm not ready to give it up yet.",	"npc_9":"Go on in then, and talk to Huff.  He'll be glad to see you.",	"npc_10":"Come back when you are.",	"player_9":"Ok, talk to you later.",	"npc_11":"Take it easy.",	"notyet":"Huff doesn't want to be disturbed.  He's waiting for his shipment with a Tusken Rifle, and he's not talking to anyone until he finds out what happened to it."
