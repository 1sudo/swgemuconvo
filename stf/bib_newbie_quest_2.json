Are you ready for another mission now? ",	"bfnq2_3":"Yes, I am ready. ",	"bfnq2_4":"No, not right now. ",	"bfnq2_5":"Good.  Our contact at Notsub shipping has informed me that the stolen documents he delivers to us on a regular basis were stolen by Valarian's thugs.  Go talk to him and find out where the thugs went.

",	"bfnq2_20":"I don't have time to do this right now. ",	"bfnq2_21":"No, Jabba is not to be bothered.  But I will let you into the Audience chamber if you are successful. ",	"bfnq2_22":"Ok, it's a deal. ",	"bfnq2_23":"What's in the Audience Chamber? ",	"bfnq2_24":"I can't help you with this right now. ",	"bfnq2_25":"Jabba's Audience chamber is where the Palace's most important guests are entertained. ",	"bfnq2_26":"Okay, I'll do it. ",	"bfnq2_27":"I can't help you with this right now. ",	"bfnq2_28":"What are you doing wasting time?  Jabba wants that shipping information. ",	"bfnq2_29":"I changed my mind.  I don't have time to do this mission. ",	"bfnq2_30":"On my way! ",	"bfnq2_31":"Good job!  Deliver those discs to Sirad Far in the Mos Eisley Cantina. ",	"bfnq2_32":"I thought I told you to take those disks to Sirad Far? ",	"bfnq2_33":"Oh, right.  On my way. ",	"bfnq2_34":"I couldn't find him. ",	"bfnq2_35":"You can find him at the Mos Eisley Cantina.  Take the discs to him now! ",	"bfnq2_36":"Sirad Far, you're under arrest! Come with us.

He told me he'd be sending someone.  You have to find those thugs.  I'm going to add a waypoint to your datapad.  This was the last place they were seen.  Kill them and take the shipping information Bib needs!",	"bfnq2_43":"I'll get them.",	"bfnq2_44":"You're awfully friendly for someone I don't know.",	"bfnq2_45":"If that's the way you want to be then talk to someone else.",	"bfnq2_46":"Heh, I know better than to think Bib would send someone incompetent.  Good luck. ",	"bfnq2_47":"Ah, you have returned with my shipping information.  Good job. ",	"bfnq2_48":"I'll let the guards know to allow you into the main Audience chamber.  Enjoy the entertainment, but don't bother Jabba if you know what is good for you. Speak to Ephant Mon if you need more things to do. ",	"bfnq2_42":"Back off with the attitude.  I'm a friend.",	"bfnq2_49":"Can I enter the Audience chamber now? "
