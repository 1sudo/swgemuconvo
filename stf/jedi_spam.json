It is a very precarious time for users of the Force and your path to become a Jedi Knight is wrought with danger and excitement.

Before you begin there are a few important things to note.  Jedi must train secretly and locating your personal trainer can sometimes be difficult.  Use the command /findmytrainer to sense the location of your trainer.  At times you may not be able to detect your trainer, if this happens wait a little while and try later.

The dedication required to learn your Force abilities will take all of your personal resources.  You will have to surrender non Jedi skills in order to advance along the path to Jedi Knighthood.

Finally, the life of a Jedi is wrought with extreme risk.  Act carefully as your actions could bring great and devastating repercussions.  Jedi are extremely susceptible to the rigors of cloning.  When a Jedi dies they will suffer an experience loss.
