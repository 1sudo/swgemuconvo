Finally, the life of a Jedi is wrought with extreme risk.  Act carefully as your actions could bring great and devastating repercussions.  Jedi are extremely susceptible to the rigors of cloning.  When a Jedi dies they will suffer an experience loss.    On behalf of the entire development team, thank you and continue enjoying your time in Star Wars Galaxies.
