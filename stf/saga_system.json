With the Star Wars Chronicles system, you now have the ability to create stories from relics you will discover throughout the galaxy. Use the Quest Builder to write your story with the relics you have discovered. Hit \"Create Quest\" to consume the relics and create a holocron in your inventory. This holocron can be traded to others or activated to begin the adventure. Completing holocrons will reward you with profession experience and tokens. Tokens can be used at the Chronicles reward vendor, S7-U44 Vending Droid, in both Theed and Coronet. The vendors are in the tent behind C-3PO. You can purchase relic booster packs from them as well as other exciting rewards.  For some friendly assistance, speak with C-3PO and he will explain more about Chronicles.      + Chronicle Master - All players can advance in the chronicle profession. Open your profession wheel and take a look at what awaits as you advance as a chronicler.     + Chronicle Quest Builder - The tool used to create holocrons or drafts.     + Draft - A saved version of your quest. Creating drafts does not consume relics. You can edit drafts freely. They can be used to create holocrons.     + Relics - Objects that represent memory, experiences, visions. You will discover relics as you play the game.     + Holocrons - By pressing \"create quest\" in the Quest Builder, you will consume the relics for your quest and produce a holocron in your inventory. This can be traded or sold on the Bazaar. Players can active them to participate in your quest.     + Sharing - As you progress in the Chronicle profession, you will gain the ability to allow your Chronicle holocrons to be shared. Sharing will allow multiple players to enjoy your quest from a single holocron.     + Fragments - Relic fragments. They are acquired through loot, as a byproduct of creating a holocron, and by deconstructing relics. Fragments can be combined to create a relic.     + Tokens - Earned for completing other people's quests. When people complete your quests, some tokens will be held in your Chronicles Reserve for you to claim. Use /chroniclerGetReserve to claim your reserve of tokens and Chronicles XP.     + Relic Booster Packs - Purchased from the Chronicles reward vendors by using tokens, they provide random relics.     *You acknowledge that SOE and its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to all materials contained in or created in connection with the Chronicle Master System.
