		"hr_1":"You look like the kind of person that could use some work.  That is, if you aren't too worried about what the \"law\" might think about it.",	"hr_2":"Yeah, I could use some work like that.",	"hr_3":"I think you have the wrong guy.",	"hr_4":"I thought you had that look about you.  I work for Jabba the Hutt.  Is that going to be a problem?",	"hr_5":"Not for me.",	"hr_6":"Sorry, I can't work for the Hutts.",	"hr_7":"Good.  What I want you to do is to find this stang who's been asking too many questions about Bib Fortuna.  Bib wants him \"eliminated\" if you know what I mean.",	"hr_8":"Consider it done.",	"hr_9":"Why does Bib care about this guy?",	"hr_12":"Ok, I'll upload his last known to your datapad.  Return here when the deed is done and we'll talk further about your usefulness.",	"hr_10":"Bib had some issues with his own people a while back, and he's sort of been hiding out here on Tatooine.  Anytime someone starts asking questions he \"deals with it\" as quickly as possible.",	"hr_11":"Well, as long as you keep our little chat to yourself I'll let you go then.",	"hr_13":"You did good work for us there.  Can we count on you to do some more?",	"hr_14":"You got it.  What's next?",	"hr_15":"I'll be back later.  ",	"hr_16":"Bib was very impressed.  He says he may have a place for you at the palace, since they've had some...uh...openings...recently.  But we need you to do just a little more to prove yourself.",	"hr_17":"That's fine, but don't take forever.  I got lots of other things to do you know.",	"hr_18":"What's my next job?",	"hr_19":"Really?  Bib was impressed?",	"hr_20":"Some thugs roughed up one of Jabba's dancers the other day in town, and Bib wants to make an example of them.  Plus I think he's trying to get the dancers to like him.  Anyway.  Just teach these guys a lesson.",	"hr_21":"Who's crazy enough to do this?",	"hr_22":"I'll get right on it.",	"hr_23":"Jabba's chief rival is Lady Valarian.  It was some of her thugs trying to act big.  They picked the wrong week cause Jabba's just been looking for an excuse.  And like I said, Bib loves to look good for the girls.",	"hr_24":"Good.  Bib's counting on you to make him look good.   You pull this off and I'll get you in to see him personally.",	"hr_25":"Congratulations.  That's good work that you do.  You're gonna do well on this planet, I can feel it.",	"hr_26":"Thanks.  I appreciate it.",	"hr_27":"Go see Bib upstairs.  He'll let you in now that he sort of knows who you are.",	"hr_28":"Well, as impressed as Bib gets, really.  That is, he didn't act disappointed or execute anybody when he heard you had killed the target.  But anyway...",	"hr_29":"You again?  Have you thought about that work I mentioned earlier?",	"seebib":"Go up and see Bib Fortuna.  My tasks are for less experienced individuals."
