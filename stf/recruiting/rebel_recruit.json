		"rr1":"The wind whistles in the willows...",	"rr2":"But the sun doesn't shine in the swamps.",	"rr3":"Uh...I don't know what you're talking about.",	"rr4":"Who gave you the password?",	"rr5":"I was just guessing.",	"rr6":"I heard it from some of the rebel pilots.",	"rr7":"Are you interested in joining the Rebel Alliance?",	"rr8":"Won't that get me in trouble with the Empire?",	"rr9":"I am.  I have no love for the Empire.",	"rr10":"Good.  I will take your information and inform my commanding officers.  From this point on, you're officially part of the Rebellion.  Good luck soldier.",	"rr11":"Well, never mind then.  I have more important things to do than stand around and explain myself to every nerf-herder that tries to chat with me.",	"rr12":"If all you're concerned about is how much trouble you're going to be in with the Empire then you're definitely not the kind of person we're looking for.",	"rr13":"Hello friend.  What can I do for you?",	"rr14":"I'm tired of being shot at by Imperials!",	"rr15":"Ok, we'll let you out of the Alliance.",	"rr16":"Since I'm not bothering you, why don't you not bother me?",	"rr17":"All right then.",	"rr18":"Thanks for nothing."
