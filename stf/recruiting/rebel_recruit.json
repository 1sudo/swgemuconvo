What can I do for you?",		"rr12":"If all you're concerned about is how much trouble you're going to be in with the Empire then you're definitely not the kind of person we're looking for.",		"rr11":"Well, nevermind then.  I have more important things to do than stand around and explain myself to every nerf-herder that tries to chat with me.",		"rr10":"Good.  I will take your information and inform my commanding officers.  From this point on, you're officially part of the Rebellion.  Good luck soldier.",		"rr9":"I am.  I have no love for the Empire.",		"rr8":"Won't that get me in trouble with the Empire?",		"rr7":"Are you interested in joining the Rebel Alliance?",		"rr6":"I heard it from some of the rebel pilots.",		"rr5":"I was just guessing.",		"rr4":"Who gave you the password?",		"rr3":"Uh...I don't know what you're talking about.",		"rr2":"But the sun doesn't shine in the swamps.",		"rr1":"The wind whistles in the willows..."
