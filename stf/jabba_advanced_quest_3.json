		"jaq3_2":"There are sensitive matters to discuss.  Meet me in my private chambers.  Here is the access code. ",	"jaq3_3":"I'll be right there. ",	"jaq3_4":"Not right now. ",	"jaq3_5":"Do not waste my time.  Return to me when you are ready for a very important job. ",	"jaq3_6":"You were slow. Come quicker next time.  Are you ready for an important mission? ",	"jaq3_7":"Yes. ",	"jaq3_8":"Not right now. ",	"jaq3_9":"You fool!  Valarian's spy must not suspect you are working for me.  Go! ",	"jaq3_11":"There is a spy in the Palace working for Lady Valarian. Find out who it is.  You are to go to work for Lady Valarian.  Tell her you are not happy with the Hutts.  Do what you must to earn her trust, and find the identity of this spy. ",	"jaq3_12":"Ok ",	"jaq3_13":"How do I convince her to trust me? ",	"jaq3_14":"I need some time to prepare before I can take this mission for you. ",	"jaq3_15":"Do not waste time.  Return to me in the main Audience chamber when you are ready then. ",	"jaq3_16":"Take an Imperial Patrol schedule to her and tell her that you stole it from me.  Then do whatever she asks of you.  Make her believe you are loyal to her. ",	"jaq3_17":"Ok. ",	"jaq3_18":"Where can I get an Imperial Patrol Schedule? ",	"jaq3_19":"I will give you the coordinates of an Imperial Patrol.  Ambush them and take their schedule to Lady Valarian.  Now go! ",	"jaq3_21":"What do you want? ",	"jaq3_22":"I have a special delivery for Lady Valarian. ",	"jaq3_23":"Nothing.  Never mind. ",	"jaq3_24":"Then get away from here before we shoot you. ",	"jaq3_25":"Then take it to her immediately. ",	"jaq3_27":"My Enforcer says you have a special delivery for me, but I know that you work for Jabba the Hutt.  So what is it? ",	"jaq3_28":"I don't work for Jabba any more.  I want to work for you.  As a token of good faith, I stole this Imperial Patrol Schedule from Jabba to give to you. ",	"jaq3_29":"I have an Imperial Patrol Schedule for you. ",	"jaq3_30":"This is useful, no doubt.  But why would Jabba send this to me? ",	"jaq3_31":"He didn't.  I stole it for you.  I don't work for Jabba any more.  I want to work for you. ",	"jaq3_32":"That's very bold of you, to steal from Jabba.  Then I have a mission for you if you want to work for me. ",	"jaq3_33":"I'll do it. ",	"jaq3_34":"What's the mission? ",	"jaq3_35":"I am expecting a shipment to land... out in the desert away from prying eyes.  But sandpeople might attack the shipment out there.  You go there and ensure that the shipment is safe while my people transfer it from the ship to their transport. ",	"jaq3_37":"Soon as that ship lands, we'll start transferring the cargo.  You keep an eye out for sandpeople! ",	"jaq3_39":"Excellent!  You protected the shipment.  You deserve this reward. ",	"jaq3_40":"Thanks! ",	"jaq3_41":"Is there anything else I can do for you? ",	"jaq3_42":"I have a dangerous mission for you, if you think you can handle it.  I want you to abuse Jabba's trust to acquire Notsub shipping information from him. ",	"jaq3_43":"Leave it to me. ",	"jaq3_44":"Couldn't I steal it from Notsub shipping instead? ",	"jaq3_45":"Don't be foolish.  If you steal it from Notsub shipping, they'll change their schedule.  Jabba has managed to steal the information without them knowing about it.  Besides, he trusts you. ",	"jaq3_46":"I see your point.  Leave it to me. ",	"jaq3_47":"No time to waste, then.  On your way! ",	"jaq3_49":"I hear you are to steal some shipping information from me.  Excellent!  I'll make it easy for you.  I'm sending you the coordinates of some expendable men I've sent outside the palace with the information.  You can dispose of them for me, and take the shipping information for Valarian so that she will trust you more. ",	"jaq3_50":"",	"jaq3_51":"Fantastic!  Jabba is a fool to let someone as talented as you are slip away from him! ",	"jaq3_52":"Yes, I am quite good.  Here's the shipping information.  Anything else I can do? ",	"jaq3_53":"Nothing to it.  Here's the shipping information.  Anything else I can do? ",	"jaq3_54":"Yes, I feel I can trust you with a very important mission.  I have a spy in Jabba's Palace.  Go there and he will contact you. ",	"jaq3_56":"Find out who the spy is and bring me the information he has stolen. ",	"jaq3_58":"You are the man Valarian sent.  Here, take this information back to her. ",	"jaq3_60":"Where are you going?  I told you to bring that data to me. ",	"jaq3_61":"What's this, a trick?  This disc is blank!  The fool must have given you the wrong one.  Go back and get the right disc this time! ",	"jaq3_63":"So, you have discovered who the spy is.  Well done.  I think it's time for our unwelcome visitor to take a ride on the Sail Barge.  Get aboard the Sail Barge if you want to see what happens to those who cross me. ",	"jaq3_64":"It is time to go for a ride on the Sail Barge! ",	"jaq3_66":"Attention please!  The Majestic Jabba the Hutt would like to announce his great pleasure with the accomplishments of one of his most trusted and distinguished colleagues.  And his fearsome displeasure with the SPY in our midst. ",	"jaq3_67":"A spy! ",	"jaq3_68":"Who would dare to spy on Jabba? ",	"jaq3_69":"Amazing!  A spy in Jabba's Palace!? ",	"jaq3_70":"Jabba wishes for you to now reveal to all assembled, who is this foolish spy? ",	"jaq3_71":"You will die now!  Throw him into the Sarlacc pit! ",	"jaq3_72":"No! No!  It's not true! ",	"jaq3_73":"Shoot him! ",	"jaq3_74":"Jabba commands that you shoot the spy... knocking.... Knocking him into the pit! ",	"jaq3_75":"Back to the Palace! "
