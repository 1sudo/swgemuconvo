		"mrq1_1":"Hi.  Are you hungry? ",	"mrq1_2":"Yes. ",	"mrq1_3":"No. ",	"mrq1_4":"I'm hungry. ",	"mrq1_5":"I have some food if you want it. ",	"mrq1_6":"How can I help? ",	"mrq1_7":"Why don't you go to the kitchen and get something to eat? ",	"mrq1_8":"Why don't you go to Mos Eisley and get something to eat? ",	"mrq1_9":"I don't have time to help you. ",	"mrq1_10":"Can you go help Porcellus?  He's supposed to make a special dish for me, but he's so busy... ",	"mrq1_11":"Ok.  I'll go help Porcellus. ",	"mrq1_13":"Who is Porcellus? ",	"mrq1_17":"Great, thanks!  Go talk to Porcellus in the Palace Kitchen and see if you can help him make my dish. ",	"mrq1_18":"Maybe you can help me later.  I'm sure I'll still be hungry. ",	"mrq1_19":"Did you bring my lunch?  I'm starving!  Go talk to Porcellus and see if you can speed things up. ",	"mrq1_21":"I'm still working on it. ",	"mrq1_22":"No, no... That's not what I'm hungry for.  Porcellus was supposed to make me a special dish. ",	"mrq1_29":"Porcellus is too busy to make my special dish.  I guess I'll just have to wait. ",	"mrq1_35":"I don't have any money.  We work for Jabba in exchange for all the food we can eat. ",	"mrq1_36":"Maybe I can help Porcellus so he'll have time to prepare your special dish. ",	"mrq1_37":"Your contract with Jabba is to work for food? ",	"mrq1_42":"Porcellus is Jabba's chef.  He's very busy preparing for a big feast right now. ",	"mrq1_47":"Yes, I negotiated the contract myself.  It's great, isn't it? ",	"mrq1_48":"That doesn't sound like a very good deal. ",	"mrq1_49":"Oh yes, that's a great deal. ",	"mrq1_50":"I thought so, too. ",	"mrq1_53":"Who are you? ",	"mrq1_54":"Well Porcellus is a really great chef.  He was the winner of the Golden Spatula Award. ",	"mrq1_58":"I'm Max Rebo.  Haven't you heard of the Max Rebo Band?  We're Jabba's favorite band. ",	"mrq1_61":"Can you teach me about music? ",	"mrq1_62":"I'm not very interested in music, myself. ",	"mrq1_63":"How about this?  If you help Porcellus then I'll teach you a thing or two about music.  My band's the best! ",	"mrq1_64":"Ok.  I'll help Porcellus and you can teach me about music.",	"mrq1_66":"What about cooking?  Are you interested in cooking? ",	"mrq1_67":"Oh yes. ",	"mrq1_68":"Not really. ",	"mrq1_69":"You know, if you help Porcellus then I'm sure he'd be willing to teach you about cooking. ",	"mrq1_70":"Ok.  I'll help Porcellus and he can teach me about cooking.",	"mrq1_72":"You don't like cooking or music?  Those are my two favorite things! ",	"mrq1_73":"Maybe there's something else you can do for me... ",	"mrq1_75":"Really?  Like what? ",	"mrq1_76":"If I help Porcellus, you have to tell Bib Fortuna to trust me with more important missions. ",	"mrq1_77":"On second thought, never mind. ",	"mrq1_78":"Oh that's easy!  I would have done that anyway! ",	"mrq1_80":"I'm too busy to talk to you.  I have far too many things to do. ",	"mrq1_81":"Max Rebo sent me to see if I could help you. ",	"mrq1_82":"Why are you so busy? ",	"mrq1_83":"Oh, Max and his special dietary preferences!  Well if you want to help, then bring me a Zucca boar so I can cook it up for him. ",	"mrq1_84":"Ok, will do. ",	"mrq1_85":"Where can I find one? ",	"mrq1_86":"If anyone knows where to find one, it'll be Ephant Mon.  Go ask him. ",	"mrq1_87":"Look, I told you I don't have time to chat.  I have to prepare a feast for Jabba and a treat for the band, and if I don't finish quickly then Jabba will throw me into the Sarlacc Pit. ",	"mrq1_88":"How can I help? ",	"mrq1_89":"Do you like working for Jabba? ",	"mrq1_91":"Good to see you again.  What are you up to these days? ",	"mrq1_92":"I'm helping Porcellus find a Zucca Boar. ",	"mrq1_93":"Not much, how about you? ",	"mrq1_94":"Oh you know, same ol' same ol' ",	"mrq1_95":"Do you know where I can find a Zucca boar? ",	"mrq1_96":"Nice talking to you.  See ya. ",	"mrq1_97":"Sure, I know all about the shipments to and from Tatooine.  A creature like that arrived at the Starport just recently, but Stormtroopers hauled it off right away. ",	"mrq1_98":"Do you know where it is now? ",	"mrq1_99":"Do you know if there are any more creatures like that on Tatooine? ",	"mrq1_100":"I don't know.  I bet Captain Fane knows, though.  Find him at the Wayfar cantina and tell him I sent you. ",	"mrq1_102":"What do you want? ",	"mrq1_103":"Nothing.  Nevermind. ",	"mrq1_104":"Can you help me find the Zucca Boar that arrived recently?",	"mrq1_105":"Sure, I know where they took that boar. Someone's been experimenting on creatures to make them strong and mean.  But I'm not in the habit of giving away information for free. ",	"mrq1_106":"Do you want some money? ",	"mrq1_107":"Is there something I can do for you. ",	"mrq1_108":"Maybe you can do me a favor.  There's a strange looking Bith that's been following me around.  I think he's up to no good.  Escort me to the cantina so that Bith won't try anything sneaky, and I'll radio you the coordinates of the Imperial facility once I've met my friends inside. ",	"mrq1_109":"Ok, it's a deal. ",	"mrq1_110":"Maybe later. ",	"mrq1_111":"Let's get going then.  Lead the way. ",	"mrq1_113":"Hold them off! ",	"mrq1_114":"I made it, thanks to you!  I'm transmitting you the coordinates where the boar was last seen.  Good luck!   ",	"mrq1_116":"There's a dangerous creature in the building.  I don't know what the Empire has been up to here, but that creature looks insane.  We'd better clear out of here; there are probably more Stormtroopers on the way. ",	"mrq1_118":"You've returned!  And you have the meat I need for Max Rebo!  Maybe I won't be thrown into the Sarlacc after all. ",	"mrq1_119":"I'll deliver the dish to Max Rebo.  He's going to teach me about music. ",	"mrq1_120":"Will you teach me about cooking while you prepare the dish?  I've heard you're a great chef. ",	"mrq1_121":"Certainly.  That will save me even more time.  Here you go.  Take that to Max Rebo. ",	"mrq1_122":"That's right.  I'm the winner of the Golden Spatula award.  Watch and learn... ",	"mrq1_124":"Finally!  Mmmm... I love Porcellus' cooking.  That sure took a long time, though.  Did you get lost on your way to the kitchen?",	"mrq1_125":"Yes. ",	"mrq1_126":"Well, it was a bit more involved than that. ",	"mrq1_127":"It's a big Palace.  Hey, ready to learn some tricks of the trade? ",	"mrq1_128":"Sure. ",	"mrq1_129":"No thanks.  Just tell Bib Fortuna what a reliable person I am. ",	"mrq1_130":"But it was... Mmmm... well worth it.  This is delicious!  Say, do you to teach you something about music? ",	"mrq1_133":"Ok, pay attention now, because I'm only going to show you once. ",	"mrq1_134":"You got it!  See you later.  Oh, if you need something else to do I think Barada was looking for some help with something... ",	"busy":"Sorry, I can't talk.  I'm busy."
