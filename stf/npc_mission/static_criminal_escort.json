		"gotowork":"I need you to finish that task I gave you earlier.  Ok?",	"cantwork":"I understand you're already working for someone else.  Come back when you're done with that job.",	"npc_1_1":"A friend of mine got mugged by black sun pirates and is too scared to come back to town.  I need someone to go make sure they can find their way back here.  Can you do it?",	"player_1_1":"Ok, I'll do it.",	"player_2_1":"Sounds dangerous.  I don't think I'm up to it.",	"npc_2_1":"Good.  Get back as soon as you can and I'll get you a shisa.  You can use it in your home as a decoration, or sell it, I don't care either way.",	"npc_3_1":"Too bad.  I would have given you a nice gift.",	"npc_reward_1":"Here's that shisa I promised ya.  I'll just put it here in your pack.",	"not_it":"No, sorry, that's not the item I was looking for...",	"npc_1_2":"My partner has all our cash, but got lost in the wilderness.  I need someone to escort them back here to me.",	"npc_2_2":"Good.  As soon as you return I'll give you something nice.",	"npc_3_2":"Well, guess I'll have to find somebody else then.",	"npc_reward_2":"Here's the decryptor.  It doesn't work all the time, but I'm sure you'll find a use for it.",	"player_1_2":"Yeah, I can do that, no problem.",	"player_2_2":"That's too much work.  I'm not doing it.",	"npc_1_3":"Are you available to help me out with something?  I got somebody new coming in and I need you to bring them straight to me.  Can you do that?",	"npc_2_3":"You do the work, you get paid.  I'll be here.",	"npc_3_3":"Not much I can do about it I guess, if you're not good enough.",	"npc_reward_3":"Here they are.  Careful, they have sharp edges.",	"player_1_3":"Yeah, I can do it.  ",	"player_2_3":"Too much work for me.",	"npc_1_4":"My partner was trying to avoid some imperial patrols and managed to get lost outside of town.  Can you go out there and make sure there's no trouble getting back to me?",	"npc_2_4":"Great.  I've got just the thing for you.  Let me know when you're back.",	"npc_3_4":"Well, you'll never be a criminal in this town.",	"player_1_4":"I can do it.  No problem.",	"player_2_4":"Thieves should do their own dirty work.",	"npc_reward_4":"Here you go.  I took this speaker from a cantina I robbed.  It'll go nicely in your house.",	"npc_4_1":"No, I think they've given up.  There might be some still around, but this should be pretty simple.",	"npc_4_2":"I don't think you need to know that just now.  Just bring my friend here.",	"npc_4_3":"Brand new.  I haven't even met them.  I don't even know if it's a male or a female!",	"npc_4_4":"No, they've given up.  Any imperials you see out there will just be a coincidence.",	"player_3_1":"Are there still Black Sun Pirates out there?",	"player_3_2":"How much cash was there?",	"player_3_3":"How new is this person?",	"player_3_4":"Are the imperials still snooping around?",	"npc_takeme_1":"Finally.  I was about to give up and try finding my way in on my own.",	"npc_takeme_2":"You're here to take me back?  Don't worry about the money.  I hid it.  It's not on me anymore.  Just get me to my friend.",	"npc_takeme_3":"Great!  I need you to take me to my new boss.  I don't even know who it is yet.",	"npc_takeme_4":"Quick, let's get back before the imperials start looking around for me again.",	"otherescort":"I think you're here to take someone else back.",	"dontknowyou":"I'm not sure who you are, but I'm not following you back to town.  No way."
