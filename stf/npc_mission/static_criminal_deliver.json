		"gotowork":"I need you to finish that task I gave you earlier.  Ok?",	"cantwork":"I understand you're already working for someone else.  Come back when you're done with that job.",	"npc_1_1":"You ever hear of the Black Sun Pirates?  They robbed me and I want to pay them back.  Unfortunately, I need to get one of their medallions to get inside their base.  Can you help me get one?",	"player_1_1":"Ok, I'll do it.",	"player_2_1":"Sounds dangerous.  I don't think I'm up to it.",	"npc_2_1":"Good.  Get back as soon as you can and I'll get you a shisa.  You can use it in your home as a decoration, or sell it, I don't care either way.",	"npc_3_1":"Too bad.  I would have given you a nice gift.",	"npc_reward_1":"Here's that shisa I promised ya.  I'll just put it here in your pack.",	"not_it":"No, sorry, that's not the item I was looking for...",	"npc_1_2":"I made a terrible mistake and got busted on camera stealing some credits from a merchant.  The trial's coming up soon and I need someone to get that camera.  I can tell you where it's at if you'll get it.",	"npc_2_2":"Good.  As soon as you return I'll give you the decryptor.",	"npc_3_2":"Well, guess I'll have to find somebody else then.",	"npc_reward_2":"Here's the decryptor.  It doesn't work all the time, but I'm sure you'll find a use for it.",	"player_1_2":"Yeah, I can get that, no problem.",	"player_2_2":"That's too much work.  I'm not doing it.",	"npc_1_3":"I've been collecting memorabilia of the Dark Jedi.  I know a guy who has a Medallion that they used.  Get it for me and I'll give you these broken holocron pieces.  I've got tons of holocrons.  They're bound to be worth something.",	"npc_2_3":"You do the work, you get paid.  I'll be here.",	"npc_3_3":"Not much I can do about it I guess, if you're not good enough.",	"npc_reward_3":"Here they are.  Careful, they have sharp edges.",	"player_1_3":"Yeah, I can do it.  ",	"player_2_3":"Too much work for me.",	"npc_1_4":"I need an electronic key to break into this warehouse I've been casing, but one of my rivals has it.  Get it for me and I'll give you some of the loot I got on my last job.",	"npc_2_4":"Great.  I've got just the thing for you.  Let me know when you're back.",	"npc_3_4":"Well, you'll never be a criminal in this town.",	"player_1_4":"I can do it.  No problem.",	"player_2_4":"Thieves should do their own dirty work.",	"npc_reward_4":"Here you go.  I took this speaker from a cantina I robbed.  It'll go nicely in your house.",	"npc_4_1":"They have too many members to know each other, so anyone with a medallion can get into their areas.  If I had one I could pass myself off as a member of the group.",	"npc_4_2":"I paid off some guys and found out it's being delivered to a highly secure area today.  You can get it on route before the guy gets there.",	"npc_4_3":"You could try to put 'em back together.  Or find someone else who collects them and sell them maybe?  I don't know, but I know they're worth something.",	"npc_4_4":"He stole it before I could get to it.  He'll rob the warehouse instead of me if you don't get it for me.  I need that key!",	"player_3_1":"How is a medallion going to help you?",	"player_3_2":"How do you know where the camera is?",	"player_3_3":"What can I do with broken pieces?",	"player_3_4":"How did your rival get the key?"
