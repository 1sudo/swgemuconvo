		"gotowork":"I need you to finish that task I gave you earlier.  Ok?",	"cantwork":"I understand you're already working for someone else.  Come back when you're done with that job.",	"npc_1_1":"You ever hear of the Black Sun Pirates?  They robbed me and I want to pay them back.  Unfortunately, I need to get one of their medallions to get inside their base.  Can you help me get one?",	"player_1_1":"Ok, I'll do it.",	"player_2_1":"Sounds dangerous.  I don't think I'm up to it.",	"npc_2_1":"Good.  Get back as soon as you can and I'll get you a shisa.  You can use it in your home as a decoration, or sell it, I don't care either way.",	"npc_3_1":"Too bad.  I would have given you a nice gift.",	"npc_reward_1":"Here's that shisa I promised ya.  I'll just put it here in your pack.",	"not_it":"No, sorry, that's not the item I was looking for...",	"npc_1_2":"I made a terrible mistake and got busted on camera stealing some credits from a merchant.  The trial's coming up soon and I need someone to get that camera.  They're delivering it soon so if you can find it and bring it to me I'll hook you up with this decryptor.",	"npc_2_2":"Good.  As soon as you return I'll give you the decryptor.",	"npc_3_2":"Well, guess I'll have to find somebody else then.",	"npc_reward_2":"Here's the decryptor.  It doesn't work all the time, but I'm sure you'll find a use for it.",	"player_1_2":"Yeah, I can get that, no problem.",	"player_2_2":"That's too much work.  I'm not doing it.",	"npc_1_3":"I had a lot of important paperwork in my briefcase, and now it's gone!  Some thief came by and grabbed it out of my hands.  If you can get it I'll give you this engraved writing stylus I got when I got my promotion.",	"npc_2_3":"Thank you...I'll be waiting anxiously for your return.",	"npc_3_3":"Surely somebody will be able to help me.  Thanks for nothing, though.",	"npc_reward_3":"Here you go.  It needs some ink, but you'll never have one better.",	"player_1_3":"I'll be back before you know it.",	"player_2_3":"There's no way.  I'm too tired right now.",	"npc_1_4":"I had an autographed ball from my favorite player in the league, and somebody took it!  If you can get it back for me I'll give you this collector's item ticket from last year's championships.  It's worth plenty.",	"npc_2_4":"Great!  Hurry back.",	"npc_3_4":"That's too bad.  I'll find somebody useful.",	"npc_reward_4":"Here you go.  See I had good seats, and I didn't let them tear it.  You should be able to get something for it if you want.",	"player_1_4":"I'll be right back with your ball kid.",	"player_2_4":"Nah.  I don't care about sports.",	"npc_1_5":"I've been collecting memorabilia of the Dark Jedi.  I know a guy who has a Medallion that they used.  Get it for me and I'll give you these broken holocron pieces.  I've got tons of holocrons.  They're bound to be worth something.",	"npc_2_5":"You do the work, you get paid.  I'll be here.",	"npc_3_5":"Not much I can do about it I guess, if you're not good enough.",	"npc_reward_5":"Here they are.  Careful, they have sharp edges.",	"player_1_5":"Yeah, I can do it.  ",	"player_2_5":"Too much work for me.",	"npc_1_6":"My family has had this heirloom glass for many years, and now it's been stolen.  I can tell you where the thief is, but I need you to bring back my glass unharmed.  Can you do it?",	"npc_2_6":"You're a life saver.  I'll give you this hand woven basket for the glass when you return.  My servants made it.",	"npc_3_6":"I thought you were a mercenary?  Perhaps you're just a librarian or some such...",	"player_1_6":"Yeah, I can get it.  I'll need some form of payment though.",	"player_2_6":"Sounds ridiculous.  Why don't you just go buy a new glass?",	"npc_reward_6":"Careful with this thing.  It's well put together, but if you crush it it won't be worth as much.",	"npc_1_7":"I've been a museum curator for many years, and on this planet we found the oldest tomb I've ever seen.  Unfortunately some grave robbers took the artifact I was studying.  If you would be so kind, perhaps you can get it back?",	"npc_2_7":"I thought so.  You look like a good man.  I'll make it worth your while.",	"npc_3_7":"Well, certainly there are other artifacts.  Too bad, this one was really good...",	"player_1_7":"Yeah, I can get it.  I hate grave robbers.",	"player_2_7":"I don't care about artifacts.  Forget it.",	"npc_reward_7":"Here you go, these bugs are very rare, and could be worth a lot if you can find a buyer.",	"npc_1_8":"I've been researching animals, but an industrial spy stole one of my cages.  It still had some cell structures in it from the creature.  I need it back before he figures out what's in it.  Can you help me?",	"npc_2_8":"Thanks.  I really appreciate it.  I'll find something to give you when you return.",	"npc_3_8":"Great.  I'm wasting my time with you then.  Do you know anyone who DOES work?",	"player_1_8":"I'll get it back.  Industrial espionage is a terrible thing.",	"player_2_8":"Oh, my, I couldn't care less about you and your problem.",	"npc_reward_8":"Here you go.  I found this nice picture of the creature I was studying.  It's really all I have to give you though.",	"npc_1_9":"I was collecting signatures to get my name on the local ballot when one of my opponents sent a thief to steal my ledger.  If you can get that ledger back for me I'll write a proclamation declaring you a good citizen.",	"npc_2_9":"Excellent.  Just let me know when you return, I'll have the paperwork drawn up.",	"npc_3_9":"That's too bad.  I could have done you a lot of favors.",	"player_1_9":"Sure, I'll get your ledger back.  I need friends in high places.",	"player_2_9":"No way.   I couldn't care less about politics.",	"npc_reward_9":"Here's your official proclamation.  It won't be valid unless I get elected, but hang onto it just in case.",	"npc_1_10":"A gang of ruffians stole part of the hyperdrive out of my ship.  Get it back for me and I'll give you something nice.",	"npc_2_10":"Ok.  Just let me know when you've got it.",	"npc_3_10":"I thought you were a tough one.  I guess not.",	"player_1_10":"Sure, I'll help you out.",	"player_2_10":"I thought pilots did their own work.  I'll be going.",	"npc_reward_10":"Here you go.  This is a picture I took taking off from an undiscovered planet.  That picture is one of a kind.",	"npc_1_11":"I need an electronic key to break into this warehouse I've been casing, but one of my rivals has it.  Get it for me and I'll give you some of the loot I got on my last job.",	"npc_2_11":"Great.  I've got just the thing for you.  Let me know when you're back.",	"npc_3_11":"Well, you'll never be a criminal in this town.",	"player_1_11":"I can do it.  No problem.",	"player_2_11":"Thieves should do their own dirty work.",	"npc_reward_11":"Here you go.  I took this speaker from a cantina I robbed.  It'll go nicely in your house.",	"player_1_12":"Sounds crazy but I'll do it.",	"player_2_12":"Sounds ludicrous.  Count me out.",	"npc_1_12":"My servants won't get me the dishes I want.  There's a guy who has a bowl that's the exact one I want.  I don't care how you do it, just get me that bowl.",	"npc_2_12":"I thought you looked like the man I wanted.  I'll reward you nicely for it.",	"npc_3_12":"Just like my servants.  No help at all.",	"npc_reward_12":"Here's a recording rod that I paid way too much for.  It's valuable but fragile.  Be careful with it."
