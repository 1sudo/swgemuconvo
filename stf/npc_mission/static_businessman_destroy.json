Come back when you're done with that job.",	"not_it":"No, sorry, that's not the item I was looking for...",	"npc_1_1":"An industrial spy has decided that the best way to help his company is by becoming a murderer and killing our top executives.  I want this guy eliminated, and I don't care to know the details.  Up for this?",	"npc_2_1":"Thank you...I'll be waiting anxiously for your return.",	"npc_3_1":"Surely somebody will be able to help me.  Thanks for nothing, though.",	"npc_reward_1":"Here you go.  It needs some ink, but you'll never have one better.",	"player_1_1":"I'll be back before you know it.",	"player_2_1":"There's no way.  Sounds dangerous.",	"npc_1_2":"There's a madman claiming to be a business executive killing young Twilek women on this planet.  I know where he is, but the police won't listen to me.

See I had good seats, and I didn't let them tear it.  You should be able to get something for it if you want.",	"player_1_2":"I'll take care of it.  Someone has to.",	"player_2_2":"Nah.  It's not my problem.",	"npc_4_1":"I can't discuss it for legal reasons.",	"npc_4_2":"I'm not sure.  Maybe he was jilted by one.  Or maybe he's just crazy.  Does the why really matter at this point?",	"player_3_1":"Who does he work for?",	"player_3_2":"Why Twileks?"
