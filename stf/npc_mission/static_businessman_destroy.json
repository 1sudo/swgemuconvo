Does the why really matter at this point?",		"npc_4_1":"I can't discuss it for legal reasons.",		"player_2_2":"Nah.  It's not my problem.",		"player_1_2":"I'll take care of it.  Someone has to.",		"npc_reward_2":"Here you go.  See I had good seats, and I didn't let them tear it.  You should be able to get something for it if you want.",		"npc_3_2":"That's too bad.  I'll find somebody useful.",		"npc_2_2":"Great!  Hurry back.",		"npc_1_2":"There's a madman claiming to be a business executive killing young Twilek women on this planet.
