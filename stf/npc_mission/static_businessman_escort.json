We'll pay you when you get back.",	"npc_3_1":"Well, if you can't help me I hope I can find someone who can.",	"npc_reward_1":"Here you go.

We don't want to be late for this meeting so let's get back quickly.",	"npc_takeme_2":"Oh good, you made it.  I got the money transferred to our bank, but I'm lost out here.  Should have hired a guide, huh?",	"escortother":"I don't think I'm the person you're looking for.",	"dontknowyou":"I don't know who you are, but I'm not going with you."
