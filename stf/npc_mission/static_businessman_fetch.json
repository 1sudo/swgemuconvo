Come back when you're done with that job.",	"not_it":"No, sorry, that's not the item I was looking for...",	"npc_1_1":"I had a lot of important paperwork in my briefcase, and now it's gone!  Some thief came by and grabbed it out of my hands.  If you can get it I'll give you this engraved writing stylus I got when I got my promotion.",	"npc_2_1":"Thank you...I'll be waiting anxiously for your return.",	"npc_3_1":"Surely somebody will be able to help me.  Thanks for nothing, though.",	"npc_reward_1":"Here you go.  It needs some ink, but you'll never have one better.",	"player_1_1":"I'll be back before you know it.",	"player_2_1":"There's no way.  I'm too tired right now.",	"npc_1_2":"I had an autographed ball from my favorite player in the league, and somebody took it!  If you can get it back for me I'll give you this collector's item ticket from last year's championships.  It's worth plenty.",	"npc_2_2":"Great!  Hurry back.",	"npc_3_2":"That's too bad.  I'll find somebody useful.",	"npc_reward_2":"Here you go.  See I had good seats, and I didn't let them tear it.  You should be able to get something for it if you want.",	"player_1_2":"I'll be right back with your ball kid.",	"player_2_2":"Nah.  I don't care about sports.",	"npc_4_1":"It was mostly my personal accounting, but there are some sensitive documents in there that I can't discuss.",	"npc_4_2":"Don't you follow sports at all?  If you did you'd know what I was talking about.",	"player_3_1":"What kind of documents did you have?",	"player_3_2":"What league are you talking about?"
