		"npc_3_1":"Well, certainly there are other artifacts.  Too bad, this one was really good...",		"npc_2_1":"I thought so.  You look like a good man.  I'll make it worth your while.",		"npc_1_1":"There's an assassin on this planet who's been killing all the top scientists in the area.  I want him eliminated and I'm willing to pay well for it.  Can you do it?",		"player_2_1":"I don't care about scientists.  Forget it.",		"npc_reward_1":"Here you go, these bugs are very rare, and could be worth a lot if you can find a buyer.",		"npc_4_1":"No one knows.  He seems to have some sort of problem with the work that we do, but we don't know why.",		"player_3_2":"What is this toxin?",		"player_3_1":"Why is he killing scientists?",		"npc_4_2":"It's a highly classified agent that we were using to destroy poisonous plants, but he's modified it to kill all vegetable matter.",		"not_it":"No, sorry, that's not the item I was looking for...",		"npc_reward_2":"Here you go.

I'm wasting my time with you then.  Do you know anyone who DOES work?",		"npc_2_2":"Thanks.  I really appreciate it.  I'll find something to give you when you return.",		"npc_1_2":"One of our assistants has gone mad and is planning on releasing a toxin into the air that would kill all the plantlife on this planet.  He must be stopped.  I can tell you where he is if you can stop him.",		"cantwork":"I understand you're already working for someone else.  Come back when you're done with that job.",		"gotowork":"I need you to finish that task I gave you earlier.  Ok?",		"player_1_1":"I'm up for it."
