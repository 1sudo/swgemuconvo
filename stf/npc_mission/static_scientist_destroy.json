Come back when you're done with that job.",	"not_it":"No, sorry, that's not the item I was looking for...",	"npc_1_1":"There's an assassin on this planet that's been killing all the top scientists in the area.  I want him eliminated and I'm willing to pay well for it.  Can you do it?",	"npc_2_1":"I thought so.  You look like a good man.  I'll make it worth your while.",	"npc_3_1":"Well, certainly there are other artifacts.  Too bad, this one was really good...",	"player_1_1":"I'm up for it.",	"player_2_1":"I don't care about scientists.  Forget it.",	"npc_reward_1":"Here you go, these bugs are very rare, and could be worth a lot if you can find a buyer.",	"npc_1_2":"One of our assistants has gone mad and is planning on releasing a toxin into the air that would kill all the plant life on this planet.  He must be stopped.  I can tell you where he is if you can stop him.",	"npc_2_2":"Thanks.  I really appreciate it.  I'll find something to give you when you return.",	"npc_3_2":"Great.  I'm wasting my time with you then.  Do you know anyone who DOES work?",	"player_1_2":"I'll stop this guy before he gets started.",	"player_2_2":"Oh, my, I couldn't care less about you and your problem.",	"npc_reward_2":"Here you go.  I found this nice picture of the creature I was studying.  It's really all I have to give you though.",	"npc_4_1":"No one knows.  He seems to have some sort of problem with the work that we do, but we don't know why.",	"npc_4_2":"It's a highly classified agent that we were using to destroy poisonous plants, but he's modified it to kill all vegetable matter.",	"player_3_1":"Why is he killing scientists?",	"player_3_2":"What is this toxin?"
