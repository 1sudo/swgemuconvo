		"gotowork":"I need you to finish that task I gave you earlier.  Ok?",	"cantwork":"I understand you're already working for someone else.  Come back when you're done with that job.",	"not_it":"No, sorry, that's not the item I was looking for...",	"npc_1_1":"I've been a museum curator for many years, and on this planet we found the oldest tomb I've ever seen.  Unfortunately some grave robbers took the artifact I was studying.  If you would be so kind, perhaps you can get it back?",	"npc_2_1":"I thought so.  You look like a good man.  I'll make it worth your while.",	"npc_3_1":"Well, certainly there are other artifacts.  Too bad, this one was really good...",	"player_1_1":"Yeah, I can get it.  I hate grave robbers.",	"player_2_1":"I don't care about artifacts.  Forget it.",	"npc_reward_1":"Here you go, these bugs are very rare, and could be worth a lot if you can find a buyer.",	"npc_1_2":"I've been researching animals, but an industrial spy stole one of my cages.  It still had some cell structures in it from the creature.  I need it back before he figures out what's in it.  Can you help me?",	"npc_2_2":"Thanks.  I really appreciate it.  I'll find something to give you when you return.",	"npc_3_2":"Great.  I'm wasting my time with you then.  Do you know anyone who DOES work?",	"player_1_2":"I'll get it back.  Industrial espionage is a terrible thing.",	"player_2_2":"Oh, my, I couldn't care less about you and your problem.",	"npc_reward_2":"Here you go.  I found this nice picture of the creature I was studying.  It's really all I have to give you though.",	"npc_4_1":"It was an ancient ritual device of some sort.  I need to study it further to find out exactly what it was for.",	"npc_4_2":"That's highly classified.  That's why I need that evidence back before someone finds out what I was doing.  You don't have a problem with this do you?",	"player_3_1":"What was the artifact?",	"player_3_2":"What kind of creatures were you studying?"
