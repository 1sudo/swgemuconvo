		"gotowork":"I need you to finish that task I gave you earlier.  Ok?",	"cantwork":"I understand you're already working for someone else.  Come back when you're done with that job.",	"not_it":"No, sorry, that's not the item I was looking for...",	"npc_1_1":"My family has had this heirloom glass for many years, and now it's been stolen.  I can tell you where the thief is, but I need you to bring back my glass unharmed.  Can you do it?",	"npc_2_1":"You're a life saver.  I'll give you this hand woven basket for the glass when you return.  My servants made it.",	"npc_3_1":"I thought you were a mercenary?  Perhaps you're just a librarian or some such...",	"player_1_1":"Yeah, I can get it.  I'll need some form of payment though.",	"player_2_1":"Sounds ridiculous.  Why don't you just go buy a new glass?",	"npc_reward_1":"Careful with this thing.  It's well put together, but if you crush it it won't be worth as much.",	"npc_1_2":"I was collecting signatures to get my name on the local ballot when one of my opponents sent a thief to steal my ledger.  If you can get that ledger back for me I'll write a proclamation declaring you a good citizen.",	"npc_2_2":"Excellent.  Just let me know when you return, I'll have the paperwork drawn up.",	"npc_3_2":"That's too bad.  I could have done you a lot of favors.",	"player_1_2":"Sure, I'll get your ledger back.  I need friends in high places.",	"player_2_2":"No way.   I couldn't care less about politics.",	"npc_reward_2":"Here's your official proclamation.  It won't be valid unless I get elected, but hang onto it just in case.",	"npc_1_3":"A gang of ruffians stole part of the hyperdrive out of my ship.  Get it back for me and I'll give you something nice.",	"npc_2_3":"Ok.  Just let me know when you've got it.",	"npc_3_3":"I thought you were a tough one.  I guess not.",	"player_1_3":"Sure, I'll help you out.",	"player_2_3":"I thought pilots did their own work.  I'll be going.",	"npc_reward_3":"Here you go.  This is a picture I took taking off from an undiscovered planet.  That picture is one of a kind.",	"player_1_4":"Sounds crazy but I'll do it.",	"player_2_4":"Sounds ludicrous.  Count me out.",	"npc_1_4":"My servants won't get me the dishes I want.  There's a guy who has a bowl that's the exact one I want.  I don't care how you do it, just get me that bowl.",	"npc_2_4":"I thought you looked like the one I wanted.  I'll reward you nicely for it.",	"npc_3_4":"Just like my servants.  No help at all.",	"npc_reward_4":"Here's a recording rod that I paid way too much for.  It's valuable but fragile.  Be careful with it.",	"npc_4_1":"Well, it's not much to look at, but I guess because it was in the safe they assumed it was valuable.  It is, but only to me really, they won't get much for it.",	"npc_4_2":"Actually I don't remember.  That's another reason I need that ledger back.  It might have been mayor...or chief of police...hm...",	"npc_4_3":"Ship parts are expensive.  They're probably trying to build their own ship, or they're going to sell it on the black market.",	"npc_4_4":"A nobleman gets other people to do these things for him.  People like you.",	"player_3_1":"Somebody stole an heirloom glass?  Why?",	"player_3_2":"What office are you running for?",	"player_3_3":"Why would they steal parts of your ship?",	"player_3_4":"Why don't you just buy your own dishes?",	"npc_1_9":"My cousin left this camera at my house during a recent visit.  He's on his way home, but if you could take this to him before he gets there I'll make sure you get something nice in return.",	"npc_2_9":"Excellent.  I have some old fireworks that we were saving for my Lifeday, but I'll let you have them instead.",	"npc_3_9":"Oh, well, if you don't need the work...",	"player_1_9":"Yeah, I can do that.",	"player_2_9":"Sounds dull.  I'll wait for something more exciting to come along.",	"npc_reward_9":"I don't know that this will actually explode, but boy if it does...",	"npc_1_10":"One of my neighbors has gone off to the reading of a will, but forgot to take their briefcase.  Can you take it out there before they arrive?",	"npc_2_10":"Oh good.  I didn't want to have to do it myself.  I'll see if I can find something nice for you.",	"npc_3_10":"Well, fine.  I didn't want to have to do all that walking myself.  These are new shoes...",	"player_1_10":"I can take it.",	"player_2_10":"No way.  Not unless I'm in the will.",	"npc_reward_10":"Well, all I had was some fireworks...we were, uh...sort of celebrating...but it has nothing to do with the will, I promise!",	"npc_1_11":"A friend of mine and I were playing practical jokes on each other, and...well, suffice to say I have a hyperdrive part here...and uh...my friend sort of needs it...can you take it?",	"npc_2_11":"Great!  I think if I went I'd come back bruised, if you know what I mean.",	"npc_3_11":"Oh, I'm not looking forward to delivering this.  My friend's gonna be mad....",	"player_1_11":"Sure, I'll help you out.",	"player_2_11":"This sounds dangerous...",	"npc_reward_11":"Thanks so much.  I'm giving you a picture my friend painted of me.  Isn't that special?",	"player_1_12":"Sure.  It's not a problem.",	"player_2_12":"This sounds like a lot of work for a smelly old bowl.",	"npc_1_12":"My cousin's on the way to an auction, but forgot the bowl we were going to sell.  Can you take it out there and hand it off?  Please?",	"npc_2_12":"Perfect.  I have to get things ready here for the stuff that we're buying to bring back.",	"npc_3_12":"Fine.  I guess I'll have to do it myself.  Or maybe someone else will come along...",	"npc_reward_12":"Here's a recording rod that I paid way too much for.  It's valuable but fragile.  Be careful with it.",	"npc_4_9":"It's a family heirloom, this camera.  It doesn't even work, but we keep it just the same.",	"npc_4_10":"All the important documentation's in the briefcase.  There's not going to be much of a will reading without it.",	"npc_4_11":"Well, see, the practical jokes sort of escalated, and now my friend has to leave so...",	"npc_4_12":"It's just a family thing.  Nobody wants the stupid bowl.  I'll tell you a secret...it smells.",	"player_3_9":"What's the deal with the camera?  Is it expensive?",	"player_3_10":"Why is the briefcase so important?  ",	"player_3_11":"How did you end up with your friend's hyperdrive parts?",	"player_3_12":"Why don't you just buy your own dishes?",	"npc_1_5":"A good friend of mine has gotten lost outside of town and needs to find a way to get back to me.  Can you help?",	"npc_2_5":"Good.  I'll let you in on a little secret...this person's not exactly a friend, but don't worry, you'll get paid for your work.",	"npc_3_5":"Oh.  Well, fine then.  Be that way.",	"player_1_5":"Yeah, I can do it.  I'll need some form of payment though.",	"player_2_5":"Sounds ridiculous.  I'm outta here.",	"npc_reward_5":"Careful with this thing.  It's well put together, but if you crush it it won't be worth as much.",	"npc_1_6":"One of my relatives is trying to get to me so that we can go to a reception together, but has managed to get lost outside of town.  Can you help out?",	"npc_2_6":"Hurry please, I don't want the party to start without us!",	"npc_3_6":"You have no idea how much damage I could do to your life.  But be gone, and if you're lucky I'll forget you.",	"player_1_6":"Sure, I'll get your friend.",	"player_2_6":"No way.   I couldn't care less about this.",	"npc_reward_6":"Here's your official proclamation.  It won't be valid unless I get elected, but hang onto it just in case.",	"npc_1_7":"My friend got lost trying to find his way home.  I think there may have been some Corellian wine involved, you know?  Can you help my friend make it back to me here?",	"npc_2_7":"Good.  When you get back we'll work out some payment arrangements.",	"npc_3_7":"I should have taken the advice of the jawas.  They told me not to trust people like you.",	"player_1_7":"Sure, I'll help you out.",	"player_2_7":"I thought rich people had servants to do their work.",	"npc_reward_7":"Here you go.  This is a picture I took taking off from an undiscovered planet.  That picture is one of a kind.",	"player_1_8":"Sounds crazy but I'll do it.",	"player_2_8":"Sounds ludicrous.  Count me out.",	"npc_1_8":"Sibling rivalry has led to a very severe game of hide and seek, unfortunately one of the players is still hiding and doesn't realize the game is over.  I need someone to find them and bring them back here to me.",	"npc_2_8":"Very nice of you, I must say.  I thought you looked a little, um...dangerous, but I can see you're as trustworthy as the day is long.",	"npc_3_8":"Just like my servants.  No help at all.  Good day.",	"npc_reward_8":"Here's a recording rod that I paid way too much for.  It's valuable but fragile.  Be careful with it.",	"npc_4_5":"Well, this and that.  There's not much to tell really.  You know.  ",	"npc_4_6":"It's my uncle's fiftieth birthday, or my aunt's fortieth birthday, or my grandparent's wedding anniversary...or...no, I can't remember.  ",	"npc_4_7":"Only when we're celebrating.  Which is pretty much every day I guess...",	"npc_4_8":"Well, when you're rich you can pretty much do what you want.",	"player_3_5":"What does this friend of yours do?",	"player_3_6":"What's the reception for?",	"player_3_7":"Does this happen often?",	"player_3_8":"You guys just play hide and seek out in the desert?",	"dontknowyou":"I'm sorry but I don't recognize you and I'm not going to follow you anywhere.",	"otherescort":"I think you're here to pick up someone else.  You're certainly not taking ME anywhere.",	"escortother":"I think you're looking for someone else.",	"npc_takeme_5":"I hope you're here to get me back to my friend.",	"npc_takeme_6":"Great!  Let's go, I don't want to miss that reception!",	"npc_takeme_7":"Somebody told you I was drunk?  Liars.  I don't drink.  Now let's get back before I get thirsty.",	"npc_takeme_8":"Thank you.  I thought I was going to be stuck out here all day.  Let's get going.",	"npc_breech_1":"Oh, you want this glass?  You can't have it!",	"npc_breech_2":"You're not getting these signatures!  I won't let that fool get elected!",	"npc_breech_3":"You want to buy some hyperdrive parts...hey!  I'll take care of you!",	"npc_breech_4":"No!  Not my bowl!",	"npc_breech_5":"Are you here to help me?",	"npc_breech_6":"Do you know where the reception is?",	"npc_breech_7":"I'm not drunk...just lost.",	"npc_breech_8":"As soon as I get back to town I'm disowning my family.",	"npc_breech_9":"Do you have my camera?",	"npc_breech_10":"Is that my briefcase?",	"npc_breech_11":"Good thing you came instead of my friend.  There would have been bloodshed.",	"npc_breech_12":"I take it you have the bowl?",	"npc_smuggle_9":"Thanks a lot, friend.  This camera is very sentimental to me.",	"npc_smuggle_10":"Well, I got to get to the reading.  Take care!",	"npc_smuggle_11":"I have to get off this planet.  See ya.",	"npc_smuggle_12":"I sure hope we get what we want out of this bowl.",	"return":"To finish this mission, return to the noble who gave you the task.",	"npc_reset":"Ok, Let me know if you can work for me later.",	"npc_backtowork":"Get to it.  I need this done as soon as you can do it.",	"player_reset":"I don't think I can do this.",	"player_sorry":"I'll get back to work.",	"npc_noloc_1":"Let me find out where he is. Come back in a few minutes and I should have more info.",	"npc_noloc_2":"Let me find out where he is. Come back in a few minutes and I should have more info.",	"npc_noloc_3":"Let me find out where it is.
