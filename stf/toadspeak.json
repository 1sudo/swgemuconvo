		"opening":"I'm a conversationally experienced NPC.  What would you like to talk about?",	"jawas":"What can you tell me about Jawas?",	"quest":"Can you tell me where I can find a quest?",	"leia":"Is Leia really that hot?",	"jawa_answer":"Well, I can tell you this, they sell scrap robots they find in the desert, they hate basketball, and they do not have a concept for the number 7.",	"scrap":"What is a scrap robot?",	"seven":"Um...number 7?...What?!?",	"quest_answer":"Depends on what kind of quest you are looking for.  The Baker has zombies in his basement, the empire needs an NWAs Greatest Hits CD, and the princess needs her shoe repaired.",	"zombie":"Zombies sound cool.  Where can I find the baker?",	"nwa":"I think I have that CD.  Who should I give it to?",	"shoe":"I trained as a shoe repairman!  How lucky is that?",	"leia_answer":"To be honest with you, I have always thought she was kind of uptight.  But man does she look good in that slave outfit.",	"han":"Is she in love with Han Solo?",	"luke":"Is she Luke's sister?",	"slave":"Slave outfit?",	"robot":"Scrap robots are just robots that the Jawas found out in the desert and basically fixed up so they could sell them cheap.  Well my cell phone is ringing so I gotta go.",	"tall":"Probably because they are short.  Also, they do not really like to play defense and the zone defense rules confuse them.  Well, I am off to get a smoothie.",	"dumb":"It is inexplicable.  You say, is it just one less than 8' and they scratch their heads.  If you actually have 7 things and try to make them count them, they explode.  Well, I have a meeting now, see you later.",	"baker":"The Baker is over by the Starport, just around the corner from the Arena.  He should be able to tell you more when you get there.",	"cd":"Great, just take the CD to Admiral Cube at the All-Star Cantina.  He will pay handsomely for it.",	"nu_shooz":"Sounds pretty lucky to me.  You can find her on Naboo hanging around the palace, limping casually from place to place and trying not to fall over.",	"wookie":"Yeah, but fear not.  I think he might be, you know, in love with the Wookiee.",	"brother":"Not at this point in our timeline.  We find that out in Jedi.",	"outfit":"Oh, sorry, that is in the future.  You see I am psychic.  But trust me, when she is chained to the big slug and Han is blind and Luke starts doing back flips.  You will see what I mean.",	"hoop":"why do they not like basketball?"
