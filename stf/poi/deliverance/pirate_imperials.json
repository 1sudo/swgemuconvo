		"m_greet":"You there, I've got some Imperials chasing my tail. You're going to help me fight them off. You understand? If you don't, I'll make sure you regret it. ",	"a_greet":"We've been chasing after this no good pirate for several days now. After hijacking a Star Destroyer captain's personal shuttle, he used it to break into the officer's home estate on Coruscant. Made a mess of the place and stole a lot of valuables including sensitive documents. I assume you'll be smart and not help this low life.  ",	"m_yes":"You're smart. They should be here soon. Get your weapon ready.",	"m_no":"Oh you are going to wish you didn't say that.

Now get out of my sight.",	"a_greet_rebel":"We've been chasing after this no good pirate for several days now. After hijacking a Star Destroyer captain's personal shuttle, he used it to break into the officer's home estate on Coruscant.

You got some plan to help me get away from them? You had better or I'm going to deal with you when I'm done with them.",	"a_no":"So you are just another pirate scum. Get them!",	"a_yes":"Good choice.",	"a_maybe":"The captain would definitely prefer having his valuables back. Go see if you can get that pirate to return the goods and pay for damages done.",	"a_no_negotiate":"The Empire does not negotiate with pirates, ever. This is how we deal with their kind&",	"m_will_negotiate":"Really? Hmm. I'm done playing with that shuttle anyway. Sure, I'll return all the stuff. I'll even pay their damages, but they had better forget they ever saw me.",	"m_no_negotiate":"And ruin my reputation?! What do you take me for? Now help me blast these Imps or else.",	"a_decline_offer":"He's a criminal and he must answer to the Empire for his crimes.

Maybe I can help negotiate this matter? ",	"m_thank_negotiate":"Well, I think I would have rather this ended with me blasting them off the face of this planet, but I suppose clearing my record is worth it this time. Thanks for your quick thinking.",	"m_waiting":"I think they're almost here. Do exactly as I say.",	"a_greet_m":"We have you now. ",	"m_greet_a":"You got nothing, Imps!
