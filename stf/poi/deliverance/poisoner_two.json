		"m_greet":"Help me, please! They're out to kill me. They claim I killed someone, and it's just not true!",	"a_greet":"Look, we have proof. The entire family is dead, and they're the only ones who could have done it. Poison in the food, it was. Don't stand in the way of justice being done. Are you going to let us take action or not?",	"m_yes":"Look, they think I am a poisoner. It's not true. It must have been food poisoning or something. Talk them out of it, or fight them off, please!",	"m_no":"But they'll kill me!",	"m_thank_combat":"I think that the leader of this mob was probably the real killer, looking to pin the blame on me. But it doesn't matter. Marya... and the children... dead either way. What a terrible world this is.",	"a_greet_rebel":"The Alliance is after this poisoning scum. They killed their whole family, every one, even the children. You've got to help us.",	"a_greet_imperial":"By order of the Empire. we're here to arrest this poisoning scum. Murdered their whole family.",	"m_maybe":"You'll see, they're crazed with grief and think I'm responsible, but I'm not. When they get here, talk to them. You'll see.",	"a_no":"You're going to help a poisoner??",	"a_yes":"Let us handle this. We saw the faces of the dead, and the agony they went through. We know what the punishment should be.",	"a_maybe":"It seems a waste of time to talk to a poisoner. Be quick about it, if you need to soothe your conscience.",	"a_no_negotiate":"Marya died with white foam on her lips, choking. The children were fallen askew in their beds. Get out of our way, or we may deal with you as we deal with the murderer.",	"m_will_negotiate":"I didn't eat the dinner that night, I tell you it must have been food poisoning. It wasn't me. Have them test the food for poison.",	"m_no_negotiate":"You'll have to fight them. Nothing I can say will change their minds.",	"a_decline_offer":"And why not eat the food? I saw the meal myself--if there hadn't been dead bodies around, I would have eaten it myself. C'mon, let's avenge Marya and the children.",	"a_accept_offer":"Maybe we are being hasty... such a terrible tragedy. I'm willing to go back and test the food to see what caused the death.",	"m_negotiate_greet":"Will they test the food?",	"response_yes":"Yes.",	"response_no":"No.",	"response_maybe":"Maybe.",	"response_negotiate":"Can a test of the food be done?",	"m_thank_negotiate":"Thank goodness you were here. I'd be dead already otherwise. You know, I am pretty sure the leader of that group is the real murderer. I'll have to find some way to prove it, though.",	"m_waiting":"They'll get here any minute now. Watch out, they're completely maddened by grief.",	"a_greet_m":"There you are! Poisoner! You killed Marya and the children!",	"m_greet_a":"No, I swear! It wasn't me! I didn't poison them!",	"a_respond_m_1":"The children, how could you? They died choking in their beds...!",	"a_thank_combat":"Excellent. Now that they're dead, nobody will ever pin the murder on me.",	"a_thank_negotiate":"I suppose we had better check on the food before doing something we'll regret. We don't want to stoop to the murderer's level. Still, I don't see how it could be true.",	"minion_1":"Murderer!",	"minion_2":"Poisoner!",	"minion_3":"Kill the scum!",	"minion_4":"How many others have you poisoned?",	"minion_5":"Kill the poisoner!",	"a_greet_mad":"You're helping a poisoner? You must be in league with them!",	"a_waiting":"Look, if you don't decide something soon, we're going to lynch this scoundrel.",	"a_negotiate_fail":"That's the most ridiculous story I've ever heard. C'mon everyone, let's take care of this murderer.",	"a_thank_negotiate_again":"OK, we'll go check the food. But suspicion will still fall on them. Which is fine by me.",	"a_brushoff":"Go away, stranger. And thanks for the help. None of these others know it, but I was the one with the poison. Now that that pathetic fool is out of the way, nothing stands between me and the money.",	"a_tired_waiting":"That's enough. In Marya's memory, scum, DIE!",	"a_no_progress":"Look, just go away. If you had know Marya and the children... you'd be upset too.",	"m_saved":"You saved me! Thank goodness!",	"m_betrayed":"No! I can't believe you're falling for their lies! I'm innocent, I tell you, innocent!",	"m_sorry":"I have nothing as a reward... please, just help me.",	"a_accept_offer_chat":"",	"a_accept_offer_mood":"doubtful",	"a_accept_offer_act":"",	"m_yes_chat":"",	"m_yes_mood":"terrified",	"m_yes_act":"",	"m_will_negotiate_chat":"",	"m_will_negotiate_mood":"nervous",	"m_will_negotiate_act":"",	"m_waiting_chat":"",	"m_waiting_mood":"worried",	"m_waiting_act":"",	"m_thank_negotiate_chat":"",	"m_thank_negotiate_mood":"thoughtful",	"m_thank_negotiate_act":"",	"m_thank_combat_chat":"",	"m_thank_combat_mood":"",	"m_thank_coombat_act":"depressed",	"m_sorry_chat":"",	"m_sorry_mood":"quiet",	"m_sorry_act":"",	"m_saved_chat":"",	"m_saved_mood":"thankful",	"m_saved_act":"",	"m_no_negotiate_chat":"",	"m_no_negotiate_mood":"emphatic",	"m_no_negotiate_act":"",	"m_negotiate_greet_chat":"",	"m_negotiate_greet_mood":"hopeful",	"m_negotiate_greet_act":"",	"m_maybe_chat":"",	"m_maybe_mood":"earnest",	"m_maybe_act":"",	"m_greet_a_chat":"",	"m_greet_a_mood":"panicked",	"m_greet_a_act":"",	"m_greet_act":"",	"m_betrayed_chat":"moan",	"m_betrayed_mood":"dismayed",	"m_betrayed_act":"",	"a_yes_chat":"",	"a_yes_mood":"sad",	"a_yes_act":"",	"a_waiting_chat":"",	"a_waiting_mood":"emphatic",	"a_waiting_act":"",	"a_tired_waiting_chat":"shout",	"a_tired_waiting_mood":"vengeful",	"a_tired_waiting_act":"",	"a_thank_negotiate_again_chat":"",	"a_thank_negotiate_again_mood":"sly",	"a_thank_negotiate_again_act":"",	"a_thank_negotiate_chat":"",	"a_thank_negotiate_mood":"doubtful",	"a_thank_negotiate_act":"",	"a_thank_combat_chat":"whisper",	"a_thank_combat_mood":"sly",	"a_thank_combat_act":"",	"a_respond_m_1_chat":"",	"a_respond_m_1_mood":"suffering",	"a_respond_m_1_act":"",	"a_no_progress_chat":"",	"a_no_progress_mood":"tired",	"a_no_progress_act":"",	"a_no_negotiate_chat":"mutter",	"a_no_negotiate_mood":"cold",	"a_no_negotiate_act":"",	"a_no_chat":"",	"a_no_mood":"indignant",	"a_no_act":"",	"a_negotiate_fail_chat":"",	"a_negotiate_fail_mood":"belligerent",	"a_negotiate_fail_act":"",	"a_maybe_chat":"",	"a_maybe_mood":"contemptuous",	"a_maybe_act":"",	"a_greet_rebel_act":"",	"a_greet_mad_chat":"",	"a_greet_mad_mood":"vengeful",	"a_greet_mad_act":"",	"a_greet_m_chat":"shout",	"a_greet_m_mood":"vengeful",	"a_greet_m_act":"",	"a_greet_imperial_act":"",	"a_greet_act":"",	"a_decline_offer_chat":"shout",	"a_decline_offer_mood":"angry",	"a_decline_offer_act":"",	"a_brushoff_act":"",	"a_brushoff_mood":"evil",	"a_brushoff_chat":"whisper"
