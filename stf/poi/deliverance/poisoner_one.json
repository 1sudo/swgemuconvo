We have friends and family to bury and mourn.",		"a_thank_negotiate_again":"I have real misgivings about this, but I'll check out the food based on your word. I just pray that you're not wrong...",		"a_negotiate_fail":"That's the most ridiculous story I've ever heard. C'mon everyone, let's take care of this murderer.",		"a_waiting":"Look, if you don't decide something soon, we're going to lynch this scoundrel.",		"a_greet_mad":"You're helping a poisoner?

You killed Marya and the children!",		"m_waiting":"They'll get here any minute now. Watch out, they're completely maddened by grief.",		"m_thank_negotiate":"You're a pretty fast talker. I appreciate that quality. I'm pretty good at mixing up the poisons, but not so good at persuading others that it wasn't me. Heh. Well, thanks, sucker.",		"response_negotiate":"Can a test of the food be done?",		"response_maybe":"Maybe.",		"response_no":"No.",		"response_yes":"Yes.",		"m_negotiate_greet":"Will they test the food?",		"a_accept_offer":"Maybe we are being hasty... such a terrible tragedy.

We know what the punishment should be.",		"a_no":"You're going to help a poisoner??",		"m_maybe":"You'll see, they're crazed with grief and think I'm responsible, but I'm not. When they get here, talk to them. You'll see.",		"a_greet_imperial":"By order of the Empire. we're here to arrest this poisoning scum. Murdered their whole family.",		"a_greet_rebel":"The Alliance is after this poisoning scum. They killed their whole family, every one, even the children. You've got to help us.",		"m_thank_combat":"Good work, sucker. Now nobody's left to carry the tale. Did I mention it was an undetectable poison? I'm scot free, and the inheritance is mine now. All mine.",		"m_no":"But they'll kill me!",		"m_yes":"Look, they think I am a poisoner. It's not true. It must have been food poisoning or something. Talk them out of it, or fight them off, please!",		"a_greet":"Look, we have proof. The entire family is dead, and they're the only ones who could have done it. Poison in the food, it was. Don't stand in the way of justice being done. Are you going to let us take action or not?",		"m_greet":"Help me, please! They're out to kill me. They claim I killed someone, and it's just not true!"
