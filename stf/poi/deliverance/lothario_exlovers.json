		"m_greet":"Help me! Please! I'm being chased by crazy women who want to kill me. I know I know, I should be able to handle myself against them, but I'm more of a lover than a fighter. Help me fend them off.",	"a_greet":"This creep told me I was his only love. He strung me along for years. All the while he was seeing all of these other women. Well we finally found out about each other. At first we argued with each other, but then we realized we all had a common enemy  him! Now get out of our way so we can teach this two-timer a lesson.",	"m_yes":"You see they were lovers of mine at one time. Sometimes love goes bad, real bad. ",	"m_no":"You don't understand. These women are going to kill me, as in cold blooded murder. My only crime is that I loved them&all&at the same time. I'm in so much trouble.",	"m_thank_combat":"I told you not to hurt them. I really did care for them, all of them, I just didn't want to face their wrath. They were just so angry. I feel terrible now.",	"a_greet_rebel":"This creep told me I was his only love. He strung me along for years. All the while he was seeing all of these other women. Well we finally found out about each other. At first we argued with each other, but then we realized we all had a common enemy  him!

Now get out of our way so we can teach this two-timer a lesson.",	"m_maybe":"Maybe you can reason with them. You see, they were my lovers, well, until they found out about each other. I didn't mean to hurt them, but now they have it in for me.",	"a_no":"You're going to take his side?! Oh you make me so mad!",	"a_yes":"Good because he's going to wish he never met any of us! ",	"a_maybe":"What can he possibly say at this point for us to want to handle this peacefully? Why don't you ask him?",	"a_no_negotiate":"He broke my heart. He was dishonest with all of us. No, we've decided to teach him not to play with any woman's affections. Now get out of our way!",	"m_will_negotiate":"What if I promise to never see the other women again? I mean it this time. Those other women meant nothing to me. I would do anything for her forgiveness. I would do what ever she asked of me to regain her trust and love. Tell her that, would you?",	"m_no_negotiate":"It's no use. I've tried to explain it to them. I loved them all differently, you see. For some reason they just don't understand that. Thanks for trying, but there is no point. ",	"a_decline_offer":"I'm sick of his smooth talking. I fell for those lines too many times. It is over this time and there is nothing he can do or say to change that. Oh, he makes me so mad!",	"a_accept_offer":"He would do anything for my love? He really just loves me and not those others? I don't know if I could trust him again, but I've put so much into this relationship I can't just turn my back on it. I'll think about it. ",	"m_negotiate_greet":"Well, is she going for it? ",	"response_yes":"Yes",	"response_no":"No",	"response_maybe":"Maybe",	"response_negotiate":"Whoa, maybe you should try to solve this peacefully. ",	"m_thank_negotiate":"Wow, that was close. You just saved my life, I mean, my relationship.",	"m_waiting":"Here they come. Remember, I don't want to hurt them. Just scare them off.",	"a_greet_m":"There you are. Did you really think you get away with cheating on me, let alone all of us? ",	"m_greet_a":"Hey darling, I didn't mean to cause you pain. They don't mean anything to me. You are my true love.",	"a_respond_m_1":"You're not going to talk your way out of this one. We've been talking. I finally understand the big picture. We all do.",	"a_thank_combat":"I didn't mean for that to happen. What have we done? I just wanted to teach him a little lesson for hurting me. I feel terrible.",	"a_thank_negotiate":"I need some time by myself to think things over. He's going to have his work cut out for him if he's going to earn my trust again.",	"minion_1":"He promised he would marry me one day.  ",	"minion_2":"He promised we would go off world together and explore the galaxy.",	"minion_3":"He promised me the moon and stars and nebulas and black holes and just about everything else there is. I can't believe he is such a liar! ",	"minion_4":"He promised me that I was the only one for him. He said we were meant to be together. He said he was going to leave that other woman for me. Now I find out he was cheating on me too. I hate him! ",	"minion_5":"He didn't promise me anything. I knew he was scum from the first moment I met him. I can't believe my sister fell for his act. He's going to pay for messing with her.",	"a_greet_mad":"There you are. You think you can get someone else to protect you from us? ",	"a_waiting":"It's time you paid for what you've done to us, you lecherous louse!",	"a_negotiate_fail":"I don't want to hear it! ",	"a_thank_negotiate_again":"Then again, he did say he loves me. Maybe I've been too hard on him.",	"a_brushoff":"I don't know how I ever trusted him in the first place. Men, ugh! ",	"a_tired_waiting":"Let's teach him a lesson.",	"a_no_progress":"Leave us alone!",	"m_saved":"What have I done? I'm going to die alone, I know it.",	"m_betrayed":"But I thought you were going to help me.",	"m_sorry":"The only thing I can give you is advice.
