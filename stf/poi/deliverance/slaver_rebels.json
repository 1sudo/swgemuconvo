Tell you what, if I see you again I'll cut you a discount on one of my slaves.",		"m_betrayed":"I should have known, just another bleeding heart rebel. My slaves are my property. If you can't live with that, then I suggest you die.",		"m_saved":"I'm free of them at last. You know, it will be a dark day if the rebellion ever comes to power and infringes on the rights of legitimate property holders like myself. Why they think slaves are worth fighting for is beyond me.",		"a_no_progress":"What do you want?",		"a_tired_waiting":"We'll be a step closer to a free galaxy with one less slaver hanging around.",		"a_brushoff":"Get lost. You obviously don't care about anything. That guy was a slaver. He kept other people as property. I don't understand how you can just sit back and do nothing when the galaxy is such a bad state.",		"a_thank_negotiate_again":"If he doesn't free his slaves, we won't bother talking next time.",		"a_negotiate_fail":"Talking to his type is just a waste of good breath",		"a_waiting":"It's time to put an end to your little business.",		"a_greet_mad":"Look out, he's got friends! ",		"minion_5":"Freedom at any price, that's what I always say.",		"minion_4":"I hate having to resort to violence, but unrepentant slavers like this guy make me so angry. We need to send a clear message that slavery should not be permitted anywhere. ",		"minion_3":"This is exactly why I joined the Alliance; to put an end to the problems of the galaxy. ",		"minion_2":"Let's get this over with.",		"minion_1":"We need to put a stop to his kind. ",		"a_thank_negotiate":"I hope you're right and he frees those slaves. Maybe there are peaceful ways of ending the injustices in this galaxy. We'll see. ",		"a_thank_combat":"You're a good fighter. The rebellion could use more people like you.",		"a_respond_m_1":"How many times did you hear that plea yourself, and then ignore it!",		"m_greet_a":"Please don't hurt me.",		"a_greet_m":"There he is! You can't run anymore. ",		"m_waiting":"Got your weapon ready?",		"m_thank_negotiate":"I'm not happy with this arrangement. I'm losing a lot of credits here, but I suppose it is better than losing my life.",		"response_negotiate":"Hold on, I can't let you gang up on this one guy. This is hardly a fair fight. ",		"response_maybe":"Maybe",		"response_no":"No",		"response_yes":"Yes",		"m_negotiate_greet":"What's it going to be?",		"a_accept_offer":"He better succeed at freeing those slaves. We're not going to rest until we put all of slavers in this sector out of business for good.",		"a_decline_offer":"Try? There is no try. He's just buying time to escape. He would probably kill his slaves before releasing them. We've had enough of his kind.",		"m_no_negotiate":"Ha ha. Release my twi'leks?! Those idiotic rebels aren't living in the real world. Tell them I'd rather die.",		"m_will_negotiate":"Release the slaves? I don't know if the other members would go for that. I can try, if it will save my hide.",		"a_no_negotiate":"Tell that to all the twi'leks he kept as slaves. He and his fellow slavers weren't interested in fair fights when they beat and killed those poor twi'leks. Now get out of our way.",		"a_maybe":"What? Do you know who this creep is? He's a vicious slaver. He doesn't deserve mercy. Tell you what, you get him to get his gang to release all of their slaves and we'll let him live.",		"a_yes":"Good. Let's rid the galaxy of this slaver scum.",		"a_no":"You must be a slaver too then. Well, there is no place for your kind in this sector.",		"m_maybe":"I don't think they are going to negotiate. You can try talking to them, but they'll probably just make up some story and kill me anyway.",		"a_greet_imperial":"Get out of our way! Our business is not with you.",		"a_greet_rebel":"Listen friend, we need you to step aside. We'll take care of this scum.",		"m_thank_combat":"Great! Those rebels are always sticking their noses where they don't belong. ",		"m_no":"No? You are just going to stand there and watch me get cut down? You worthless nerf herder.",		"m_yes":"You will? Whew, I'm so glad you came along. I would be dead otherwise.",		"a_greet":"This is none of your business. We ask that you step aside and let us do what we came here to do. ",		"m_greet":"I need your help. There are a band of thugs coming after me. I don't know why but they seem to want to kill me. I want you to help me fight them off. "
