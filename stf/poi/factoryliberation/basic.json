		"a_greet":"I've never seen you before...what are you doing out here?  This facility is off limits to outsiders.",	"r_greet_maybehelp":"Hey, I'm looking for work.  Maybe you have something I can do to help out here?",	"a_rejecthelp":"We don't need your help.  We have enough 'help' over in that containment area.  Unless you want to join them, you'll turn around and walk back the way you came.",	"r_greet_insult":"Fine, I don't want to waste my time talking to you anyway.",	"a_insult":"If you don't turn around and leave, you'll have plenty of time to waste in the containment pen with the other workers.",	"a_mood_angry":"Angry",	"a_attackafterinsult":"Alright, punk, I've had enough of your snooping around.",	"a_angryaftermaybehelp":"There isn't any work for you here.  Go away!  I'm being friendly.  I won't ask you again.",	"m_greet_0":"Nice to finally see a friendly face.  My compatriots and I were captured by this pirate gang and forced to work in their munitions factory.  Two of my friends were already killed in a detonator accident.  If you can find some way to help us escape, we'll be forever in your debt.",	"m_greet_1":"I see you've talked to the gang leader.  He's a filthy kind of scum.  Raided my farm and captured us all.  He's forcing us to work in that munitions factory.  Two my friends have already been killed.  Please help us, we can't hold out much longer.",	"r_m_greet_yeshelp":"Your story is a sad one and I will help you if I can.  I'll see what I can do, although these pirates seem well equipped.",	"r_m_greet_nohelp":"I sympathize with your position, but I like being on this side of a containment grid.  Goodbye.",	"m_yeshelp":"By all that is sacred!  You will help us?  I can't believe this.  We've been working to weaken one of the walls of the containment grid.  A few blaster shots should destroy it.  If you do this, we will truly be in your debt.",	"m_nohelp":"I have a family!  I have children and yet you would leave me here to work until I die?",	"m_helpyet":"Why haven't you attacked?  If you do not hurry the pirates may become suspicious.",	"m_disdain":"You sicken me.",	"a_nohelp":"Hahaha, I saw you talking to that bastard farmer.  Refused his pleas, eh?  A smart decision.  Now you had best move on as I have no interest in talking to you any longer.",	"a_yeshelp":"I saw you talking to that prisoner.  Leave now if you want to keep your hide.",	"a_title":"Captain",	"m_title":"Land Owner",	"mm_title":"Farmer",	"m_minion_1":"My master, the Land Owner, has a plan to set us free.",	"m_minion_2":"We've been forced to work by the pirates in their factory.",	"m_minion_3":"I'll probably never see my family again, if the Land Owner's plans fail.",	"m_minion_4":"If the pirates see you, you'll soon be in here with us.  Go speak with the leader of our group, the Land Owner.  With your help, we could escape!",	"m_minion_destroywall":"The pirates are all dead?  We can't escape until the prison walls are destroyed.  Fire on the wall and set us free!",	"m_minion_thanks":"You saved us!  How can we ever repay you?",	"m_minion_saved":"I can see my family again!",	"m_minion_killantagonists":"We dare not escape until all of the pirates are dead!",	"m_destroywall":"Amazing!  You defeated the pirates!  The prison walls still stand.  Destroy the damaged wall and set us free!",	"m_thanks":"You cannot comprehend our gratitude.  We owe you our lives.  Bear this mark as a symbol of your heroic altruism!",	"m_saved":"We're saved!",	"weakened_wall_name":"Weakened Wall",	"a_minion_1":"Go talk to the Captain, I don't have the rank to set up any deals.",	"a_minion_2":"I'm on guard duty, go talk to the Captain if your looking for work.  Heh, heh.",	"a_minion_3":"Are you a new recruit?  Go report to the Captain.",	"a_minion_4":"You should leave.  Now.  If you bother the Captain things could get ugly.",	"m_killantagonists":"You've managed to bring down the wall!  There are still pirates alive, however.  We can't escape until they are all dead.",	"m_somepiratesdead":"Some of the pirates holding us captive have been slain!  We are being saved!",	"m_killingpirates":"You are attacking the pirates?  You have our gratitude.  You must defeat them all for us to be safe.",	"a_defendwall":"Defend the wall!  The enemy is trying to free the workers!",	"m_celebratewall":"That's it!  Destroy that wall and we'll be free!",	"m_minion_celebratewall":"Go go go!  Bring it down!",	"m_walldamaged":"The wall is damaged!  Keep hitting it!",	"m_minion_walldamaged":"The wall looks pretty bad, keep blasting it!",	"m_freedom":"Free at last!  Being forced to work in this factory was truly a nightmare!",	"m_letsgo":"Okay boys, let's get out of this hell hole!"
