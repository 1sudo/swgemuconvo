		"m_greet":"Well met, traveler.  What brings you to my small and lonely abode?",	"r_m_greet":"I was adventuring and happened across it.  I came to see who lived here.",	"m_herotalk1":"Merely an old man.  I keep to myself and tend my books.  I think.  I philosophize.",	"r_m_herotalk1":"Out here in the wilderness? Alone?",	"m_herotalk2":"I am able to watch after myself.",	"r_m_herotalk2":"What do you philosophize about, old man...that is if the winds haven't scoured your mind clean by now.",	"m_herotalk3":"Such talk.  Mind your manners child.  I philosophize of the state of our worlds.  Of these dark times.",	"r_m_herotalk3":"Dark times? What do you know of dark times?",	"m_herotalk4":"Pirates and criminals travel freely.  The Old Republic has been shattered.  The Jedi have been hunted to all but extinction.  Over all of this hangs the shadow of the Empire.",	"r_m_empiregood":"You speak boldly of what you know little of.  The Empire has brought justice and peace to much of the civilized galaxy.",	"r_m_empirebad":"You speak truly.  The Empire rules ruthlessly and unjustly.",	"m_herotalk5":"I have no interest in bandying words with you, child.  Educate yourself...seek out enlightenment...then perhaps we might have a civilized discussion.",	"m_herotalk6":"It is my belief that the galaxy is in dire need of heroes.  Those individuals who have demonstrated beyond doubt their dedication to the path of light.  You are brash and young, but perhaps one day you will become a hero and bring light to this darkened place.",	"r_m_herotalk6":"I wish to become a hero.",	"m_herotalk7":"A noble intent, but intentions in the face of a challenge are as dust upon a Tatooine windstorm.  One must act and through ones actions one might be proven a hero.",	"r_m_herotalk7":"How do I prove that I am a hero?",	"m_herotalk8":"Travel the world.  Perform acts that demonstrate your heroism.  Through these actions you will be transformed.  A hero must be honorable, intelligent, courageous, and altruistic.  You must seek to help the world despite the cost.",	"r_m_herotalk8":"I will do these things.",	"m_herotalk9":"Return to me when you have proven the measure of your character.  An act of honor.  An act of intellect.  An act of courage.  An act of altruism.  Demonstrate to me these characteristics and I will bestow upon you the Symbol of Heroism.",	"r_m_herotalk9":"What is the Symbol of Heroism?",	"m_herotalk10":"I wasn't always an old man.  Many years ago I won many a campaign against the forces of darkness.  I wore the symbol about my neck as a reminder of my cause.  I would pass this thing to the one I believe capable of continuing my work.",	"r_m_herotalk10":"I will seek to prove my character.",	"m_herotalk11":"Go then.  One cannot become a hero by spending all day chatting with a crazed old man...and may the force be with you.",	"m_chatter_1":"Looks like another storm.",	"m_chatter_2":"Where did I put that pot at?",	"m_chatter_3":"Do I know you?  Did I know you?  I often forget things.",	"m_chatter_4":"I feel tired.  Maybe I'll lay down for a bit.",	"m_heroreturned":"Ah!  The hero returns!  It is good to see you are still well.",	"m_youareahero":"I see the marks you bear.  An act of honor.  An act of courage.  An act of intellect.  An act of altruism.  Can it be?  Have I found the one I have sought for so long?",	"m_youareahero2":"You have done great things in the name of the light.  I am honored to be in your presence.  Take my Symbol of Heroism and let it remind you of your cause.  Do not forget why you fight.  Good luck, young warrior.",	"r_m_relatestory":"Relate the tales of your adventures."
