		"cheater_transfer":"Enzymes no longer contained within player %TT's inventory. Exiting incubation session.",	"comm_activate":"Hello, I am a representative from BBP, Binring Biomedical Products. We will be monitoring your progress, this is for your own protection.",	"comm_attrib_mutation_1":"What's this? A type 1 mutation? That is rare, congratulations on increasing your experiments attributes.",	"comm_attrib_mutation_2":"Ah very nice! You have managed a type 1 mutation. Your experiment has had its base attributes altered, congratulations.",	"comm_attrib_mutation_3":"Very well done! I am showing a type 1 mutation. I wouldn't be surprised to see your experiment come out with better attributes.",	"comm_rdm_mutation_1":"Greetings! I am from the BBP, Binring Biomedical Products, and I am registering a potential DNA mutation in your Incubator. It could be nothing, but you may want to watch your experiment for any changes.",	"comm_rdm_mutation_2":"BBP here. I am registering a spike in your containment levels. What are you doing over there? You keep this up and who knows what will happen! I recommend you stop immediately, you don't want to end up with some kind of mutant do you?",	"comm_rdm_mutation_3":"STOP! What have you done!? You are going to overload the BIU. Whatever it is you just did, don't do it again. You may have already contaminated your DNA. For all we know, you will end up with some kind of mutant.",	"comm_vader_mutation_3":"Citizen, the results of your efforts have come to my attention. Continue your success, I am watching.",	"convert_pet_item_prompt":"Are you sure you want to convert your stuffed pet into a DNA core? When you do this, the stuffed pet will be transformed into a DNA core. You can then use that DNA core in an incubator, to grow a new clone of your old stuffed pet.",	"convert_pet_item_title":"Stuffed Pet Conversion",	"convert_pet_item_to_dna":"Extract DNA Core from Stuffed Pet",	"dna_already_sampled":"Someone has already attempted to sample this creature's DNA!",	"dna_cannot_mounted":"You cannot extract DNA while mounted.",	"dna_cannot_vehicle":"You cannot extract DNA from a vehicle.",	"dna_creature_not_on_list":"This creature has no viable DNA for incubation.",	"dna_failed_get":"You failed to get any usable DNA.",	"dna_invalid_target":"Invalid target",	"dna_is_in_combat":"You cannot extract DNA until the creature is no longer in combat.",	"dna_is_pet":"You cannot extract DNA from a pet.",	"dna_sampled":"DNA received and stored in containment.",	"full_station":"This incubator has the maximum amount of power it can hold.",	"inventory_full":"Your inventory is full, please make room and try again.",	"need_power":"You must add more Power to this incubator!",	"not_enough_time_since_last_session":"You cannot do this yet. Your incubator needs more time to take effect from the last session.",	"report_pet_conversion_fail":"Your pet failed to convert. Please report this failure to CS as a bug. They will have logs they can send to development, so we can track down the reason. Thanks for your patience.",	"sys_message_attribute_mutated":"Your experiment's attribute '%TT' has been updated by %DI and is now increasing by %DF% this session.",	"type_mismatch":"The type of power in your inventory does not match what is currently in the incubator.  Use more of the same type of power or remove the current power from the incubator and try again.",	"time_left":"This process will complete in:",	"station_no_remove_dna":"A session is already in progress, you cannot add or remove DNA",	"place_dna":"Place DNA in Incubator.",	"remove_egg":"Remove the egg from the Incubator.",	"sid_only_dna_can_add":"You can only put DNA in here.",	"sid_station_has_dna_already":"This station already has DNA",	"dna_failed_full_inventory":"Could not store DNA. Possibly because you have a full inventory.",	"cheater_bad_id":"Bad terminal or player id sent. Exiting incubation.",	"station_has_dna_already":"You cannot add DNA to a station that has already started processing.",	"cheater_dna_changed":"DNA in incubator does not match initial DNA. Session failed.",	"only_dna_can_add":"You can only add DNA to the incubator.",	"no_trial_accounts":"Trial accounts are not able to use the incubator.",	"comm_mutation_color_correct":"I am registering some interesting readings with your Incubator. Why did you choose such a Lyase color?"
