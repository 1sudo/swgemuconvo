		"enemy_4":"I know you! Hanging around the museum, right? Tell Dinhilt this is no gemstone. You won't believe this, but -- Hey, what are you do--?",		"enemy_3":"You are the fence? Late! Dinhint did say right about how much valuable is this hunk of junk, yes? Wait! You are not --!",		"enemy_2":"Hmm. Has that lickspittle of a curator changed his mind? I shall not cancel our arrangement. Rather, I shall cancel you.",		"enemy_1":"Utinni! Nik maikka dinnika Dinhint!",		"gotowork":"Ah, you're here. But -- you have not yet resolved the matter we discussed, correct? Please return when you have results.",		"player_3_4":"What kind of artifact is it?",		"player_3_3":"Why are you seeing so many thefts at your museum?",		"npc_reward_4":"Thank you indeed! I daresay the museum's collection would not be perceptibly harmed by the absence of this meat. But as a matter of principle, we must not tolerate artifact theft -- a point I hope the Imperial budget committee remembers when they allocate funds.",		"npc_reward_3":"This is yet another reason I am in your debt. Perhaps you will spread the word among Imperial authorities that this museum requires a greater budget to prevent theft.",		"npc_reward_2":"The armor appears to be in acceptable condition. Thank you again for your exemplary service. I anticipate a budget increase to handle these thefts soon.",		"npc_reward_1":"Fine work! The robe appears relatively harmed after its ordeal. These senseless thefts grow ever more frequent. I hope the Empire will grant my petition for an increased theft-control budget.",		"npc_4_4":"When the Hutts first arrived on Tatooine, long ago, they held a mass slaughter and subsequent feast. The artifact is, as best we can tell, a chunk of dried meat left over from that initial feast. Will you retrieve it?",		"npc_4_3":"It is purely a function of budget, I assure -- hem! I must requisition yet more funds for greater anti-theft protection. It is a terrible indictment of Imperial funding priorities, no? Hem! Now as to the mission?",		"npc_4_2":"It is the endless dust of this desert. Over the decades I must have inhaled enough to fill a -- hem! -- a binary load lifter. Now, the mission?",		"npc_4_1":"The artifact in question is a robe supposedly worn by the Tusken Raider who led the original assault on Fort Tusken centuries ago. The robe's provenance is questionable, but I know no better candidate. I would -- hem! -- very much like it back.",		"npc_3_4":"Understandable. I wish you well in your travels around our world.",		"npc_3_3":"Very well, I wish you good luck in your other endeavors. Enjoy the museum.",		"npc_3_2":"Not available just now? I understand. Please enjoy your visit to my little sanctuary. Hem!",		"npc_3_1":"I apologize for my mistake. Please enjoy your visit to my little sanctuary. Hem!",		"npc_2_4":"Splendid. You will recall, of course, that all museum artifacts have tracking beacons. It is fortunate the thieves never think to disable these! Please locate the thief and return the artifact by any means.",		"npc_2_3":"I trust the tracking beacon hidden within the scanner will lead you to the culprit, as always. Please return the item intact.",		"npc_2_2":"Good. The armor, like the robe you returned earlier, has a tracking beacon that should lead you right to the thief. I speed you on your way!",		"npc_2_1":"Excellent. The stolen Tusken Raider robe has a hidden homing beacon, as is standard museum procedure. In all likelihood you will find the thief at the designated coordinates. Thank you, thank you!",		"npc_1_4":"It defies belief, my friend, but -- hem! -- my museum is once again the victim of theft. I have no idea who would steal this artifact -- but the Hutts have many enemies, hem! So it is not inconceivable -- but I am maundering. Will you retrieve the artifact?",		"npc_1_3":"Ah, you are ready for more work? I hoped you would inquire. Hem! Now some thief has stolen a mineral scanner that dates back to the original settlement of Tatooine. It defies understanding why anyone would steal it; it lacks -- hem! -- notable historic or economic value. Can you return it safely?",		"npc_1_2":"Ah, welcome back. Hem! You helped my little museum greatly in what I now call the Tusken Robe Incident. Might you now handle a similar -- hem! -- regrettable theft? The purloined object is a part of the armor worn by chief miner Melnea Arnthout, one of Tatooine's -- hem! -- original settlers. Will you go after it?",		"npc_1_1":"Well, well, a visitor. Hem! Welcome to my humble museum. I am the curator. If you are here regarding the recent theft of a valuable artifact, I am -- hem! -- the one -- hem! Excuse me. -- You may talk to me. Will you pursue the thief and return the artifact?",		"player_3_2":"Why are you coughing? Are you all right?",		"player_3_1":"What is this valuable artifact?",		"player_2_4":"Can't do it.",		"player_2_3":"Not today.",		"player_2_2":"Not a chance.",		"player_2_1":"No.",		"player_1_4":"Ok, I'm game.",		"player_1_3":"Yeah, why not.",		"player_1_2":"Sure.",		"player_1_1":"Yes."
