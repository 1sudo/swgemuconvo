		"greeting":"A straggler, eh?  Don't be shy, come on forward.",	"explain_lookat":"Well, I have things for you, but I won't give you the time of day unless you actually converse with me.",	"convo_1_start":"That's more like it.  Well, I'm your supply disbursement officer.  I don't see why we should waste good supplies on refugees like you.",	"convo_1_reply_1":"What happened?",	"convo_1_reply_2":"What supplies?",	"convo_1_more":"You people, you're all the same. Look, you were on a ship with dubious credentials. The Star Destroyer hailed you, and you didn't stop fast enough. So they boarded, and brought the survivors over here.",	"convo_1_stuff":"There's some stuff left that the other refugees didn't take. Not much though. In the drum right here.",	"clone_greeting":"Well hello!  Please allow me to answer any questions that you might have.",	"clone_prompt_convo":"Remember, to speak to me just click-and-hold on me until you get the radial menu, and then select the CONVERSE menu option.",	"convo_2_start":"I'm here to explain Cloning and Insurance.  Where would you like to begin?",	"convo_2_reply_1":"Cloning",	"convo_2_reply_2":"Insurance.",	"convo_2_cloning":"If something should happen to you, your clone will take over with all the skills you had at the time you died.  Though you always have the option to respawn at the nearest cloning facility, unless you've cloned there you will emerge with many, many wounds.",	"convo_2_reply_3":"How often should I clone?",	"convo_2_insurance":"Insurance is a way of better preserving the condition of your belongings in the event of your untimely demise.  The return of nominally damaged, insured items to a cloning facility fetches a much higher price with the facility at which you choose to clone since you subsidize their item retrieval programs by purchasing insurance.",	"convo_2_reply_4":"What happens to uninsured items?",	"convo_2_cloning_2":"You should clone yourself whenever you want the option to emerge from that particular location. Otherwise you will appear at the closest cloning facility from where you died, with many wounds. You will also need to set a new cloning location when you travel to a new planet, because there is no interplanetary cloning.",	"convo_2_reply_5":"Do I need to clone again every time I die?",	"convo_2_insurance_2":"Your items will suffer a significantly increased decay rate when transported back to your clone. People like to be paid, and cloning facilities don't pay much for recovery of uninsured items; so it stands to reason that uninsured items tend to not be cared for as well as their insured counterparts.",	"convo_2_reply_6":"Running back to my corpse sounds like fun!",	"convo_2_reply_7":"I hate the idea of running to my corpse!",	"convo_2_cloning_3":"No.  Only when you want to have the option of appearing at a particular location without a lot of wounds, regardless of where you died.",	"convo_2_reply_8":"Do I have to insure my items every time I die?",	"convo_2_insurance_3":"You must like living life on the edge.... or you like traveling.",	"convo_2_insurance_5":"Yes!  Insurance is only valid one time.  If you want your items returned to you in a condition similar to last you saw them, you'll have to insure the item again!",	"convo_2_insurance_4":"I don't blame you.  It sounds like a real chore.",	"convo_3_explain_terminal_1":"Use terminals like this one, located in cloning facilities, to store your clone data.",	"convo_3_explain_terminal_2":"I also have an insurance terminal for you here, where you may insure your items to prevent loss.",	"convo_1_agree":"There's nothing to it.",	"banker_greeting":"Well hello!  Come talk to me if you need assistance with this terminal",	"banker_1_start":"Well it seems your ship wasn't carrying contraband after all.  Pity we didn't discover that sooner...",	"banker_1_reply_1":"What did you do to my ship?",	"banker_1_reply_2":"What is this terminal for?",	"banker_2_start":"Well we suspected you were smuggling, so we boarded the transport you were traveling aboard, of course.  Don't worry. We've cleared you of all charges.",	"banker_2_reply_1":"Can I get back on board the transport now?",	"banker_2_more":"I'm afraid not.  It seems your ship was badly damaged and most of your possessions were destroyed.",	"banker_2_reply_2":"What am I supposed to do now?",	"banker_2_explain":"Don't worry!  We've taken care of everything.  We've given you more than enough credits to reimburse you for your loss.  You can deposit them at this banking terminal.",	"banker_2_reply_3":"What about my supplies and equipment?",	"banker_2_explain_2":"When you get to a planet, look for a commodities market and buy anything you might possibly need.",	"banker_2_explain_terminals":"For your convenience, we'll allow you to access this starport's bank terminal.",	"banker_1_reply_3":"Bank?",	"banker_1_reply_4":"Item dispenser?",	"banker_2_explain_bank":"Once we realized you were innocent, we reimbursed you with a generous number of credits for the destruction of your gear.  You can deposit them in this bank terminal.",	"banker_bank_reply_1":"Why should I bank?",	"banker_2_more_bank":"You should definitely use the bank's safety deposit feature to keep your items safe from harm. It's also a good idea to deposit your credits into your bank account before shopping at the commodities market since the market deducts credits from your bank account for all purchases.",	"banker_2_bank_question":"What if I want to buy something?",	"banker_2_bank_answer":"You don't need cash on hand to buy things.  You can purchase items from the commodities market on any planet, and the credits will be deducted from your bank automatically.",	"banker_bank_question_2":"Can I store items in the bank?",	"banker_bank_answer_2":"Any items you store in this bank will be transferred to your new bank.  Once you get to your planet, join any bank there and we'll send these items along.",	"banker_bazaar_1":"Once you've deposited your money at the bank terminal, browse the Item Dispenser to see if there is any equipment you'd like to purchase.",	"banker_bazaar_reply_1":"You didn't give me very much money.",	"banker_bazaar_2":"I think The Empire is being more than generous.  Do you know how much it cost us to capture the transport you were on, kill the crew, search for secret cargo holds... not to mention pulling you out of the fire!",	"banker_bazaar_reply_2":"But that transport wasn't smuggling anything!",	"banker_bazaar_3":"Ah, but now, how were we supposed to know that without capturing the transport first?",	"trooper_move_along":"Move along.",	"leave_me_alone":"Oh leave me alone!   I've lost everything!",	"darn_empire":"The empire has ruined us!  We had our life savings on that transport!",	"ins_user_bark_1":"There's a crazy criminal on the loose!  I hope you've insured your items!",	"ins_user_bark_2":"All my items are insured... are yours?",	"ins_user_bark_3":"It's a dangerous world.  I'm sure glad there's an insurance terminal right here.",	"greeter1_bark1":"Ah, I see we have another refugee from the freighter.",	"greeter1_bark2":"Well, you're one of the lucky ones.  Most passengers didn't survive.",	"greeter1_bark3":"You should know better than to take passage with criminals.",	"pirate_taunt2":"You'll never take me alive!",	"pirate_taunt1":"Come any closer and I'll shoot!",	"pirate_taunt3":"Well I bet you weren't expecting.... A GRENADE!",	"pirate_taunt4":"What the...?  This grenade is defective!  Oh no!",	"pirate_attack":"I'll kill ya!",	"convo_1_reply_3":"The survivors?  You mean the Empire killed civilian passengers?",	"convo_1_explain":"They weren't civilians.  They were dissidents.  Officially, anyway. Now, go get your free supplies from this drum right here, courtesy of the generosity of the Empire.",	"off_1_greeting":"Say... you're still alive!  That's amazing.",	"off_1_start":"Good show, in there.  You're quite resourceful.",	"off_1_reply_1":"I'd be even better with a little training.",	"off_1_reply_2":"Combat isn't really my thing.",	"off_1_gotrain":"Well there's someone you should talk to right over there.",	"off_1_gotrain2":"Ha ha ha!  I suppose not.  Hey, there's someone right here you should talk to about that.  I bet you could learn something.",	"trainer_grunt":"Huh?",	"mission_hail":"You there.  No time for that now.  I've got something for you to do.",	"mission_1_start":"What took you so long to get here?  The shuttle's ready to leave!  Take these release documents to the Quartermaster and get yourself off my space station.",	"mission_1_reply_1":"Where is the Quartermaster?",	"mission_1_reply_2":"Will do!",	"mission_1_waypoint":"Here are your release documents.  Now get moving!  The Quartermaster is just down the hall, there. ",	"quarter_greeting":"Finally!  The last of the survivors, I take it?",	"quarter_nodocs":"You don't have your release papers?  Well you'd better go get them from the Corporal.  Make it snappy!  Hup!  Hup!",	"release_docs":"Release Documents",	"quarter_1_start":"Ah!  I see you have the proper documents there.  I'll just take those from you.",	"quarter_1_reply_1":"Can I leave now?",	"quarter_1_reply_2":"Where are you sending me?",	"quarter_1_go":"You may use the travel terminal here and purchase a ticket to anywhere you want to go.  And don't worry about the cost; the Empire will be picking up the tab on this one.",	"quarter_wait":"Wait a minute there!  You can't use that travel terminal without the proper authorization.  Do you have your release documents on you?",	"shout_panic1":"Aaaaiiiiiii!  We're all gonna die!",	"shout_panic2":"Mad pirate on the loose!  He's got a bomb!",	"shout_panic3":"Someone DO something!!",	"shout_panic4":"Shouldn't you be taking care of that crazy pirate or SOMETHING?!",	"convo_4_start":"Y-you can't go IN there.  He cut them to pieces!  He's crazy...!",	"convo_4_reply_1":"Calm down, I'm sure that everything will be under control soon.",	"convo_4_reply_2":"So how do I get out of here?",	"convo_4_explain_1":"Uh huh.  Look, y-you look pretty capable.  C-could you take a peek and see if there are any survivors in the hallway?",	"convo_4_reply_3":"Why don't you go?",	"convo_4_reply_4":"Sure, I'll check for survivors.",	"convo_4_explain_2":"The only way through is here.  Past... him.",	"convo_4_reply_5":"Then I guess I have to go that way.",	"convo_4_reply_6":"Sure, I'll check for survivors.",	"convo_4_explain_3":"I, uh, need to stand guard.  In case reinforcements come.",	"convo_4_weapon_1":"Use the pistol in your inventory to destroy the debris then use it to take out the pirate.",	"convo_4_reply_7":"Thank you.",	"convo_4_end":"Sure, whatever.  Look, I think I'll stand guard from the other side of the room, Ok?  And whatever you do, don't get this maniac angry!",	"convo_4_repeat":"What are you doing here?  Get a move on.  I'm, uh, still guarding here.",	"nervous_guy1":"You couldn't PAY me to go down that hallway!",	"nervous_guy2":"That pirate is crazy!  He blocked up the hallway and threatens anyone that goes near him!",	"nervous_guy3":"I bet the Empire will send him to the spice mines on Kessel",	"nervous_guy4":"You can't be thinking of going down that hallway?!  Didn't you hear?  CRAZY PIRATE ON THE LOOSE!",	"nervous_guy5":"I wish I could go home...",	"celeb_guy1":"I can't believe that crazy pirate is dead.",	"celeb_guy2":"That must have been a tough battle.",	"celeb_guy3":"I'm sure glad that's over with.",	"celeb_guy4":"Good thing someone came along to kill that pirate.  We'd have been trapped in here forever.",	"celeb_guy5":"I hate pirates.",	"mission_repeat":"Stop messing around with that terminal and deliver your papers to the Quartermaster!",	"trapped_guy1":"I don't understand why you won't give me release documents too...",	"trapped_guy2":"I was going to kill that pirate.  It's not my fault someone beat me to it.",	"trapped_guy3":"So I'll be shipped off to the spice mines?  That's not fair!  I heard someone killed the pirate and you're letting them go!",	"trapped_guy4":"This is an outrage!  I demand my release papers this instant!  Uh... please?",	"trapped_guy5":"You destroyed my ship!  Ruined my life!  And now you're refusing to release me!  Who is in charge here?",	"good_job":"Good job with that pirate, but what are you doing back here?  Go back through the big room where the pirate was.",	"refugee1":"They're going to ship us off to the spice mines of Kessel.",	"refugee2":"The Emperor has disbanded the Senate, now the Empire can do whatever it wants.",	"refugee3":"But we're innocent!  We weren't carrying any contraband.  They attacked us for no reason.",	"refugee4":"I never should have left Alderaan... Oh, wait...",	"refugee5":"I told you we couldn't outrun an Imperial Star Destroyer.",	"quarter_1_go_nochoice":"You may use the travel terminal here and be on your way.  And don't worry about the cost of transportation, the Empire will be picking up the tab on this one.",	"jedi_bark_1":"Run!  Get out of here!  Use the terminal to get yourself off the station!",	"jedi_bark_2":"Don't just stand there!  Use that terminal!  Get off the space station!",	"jedi_bark_3":"Don't just stand there!  Use the terminal!  Get away before he kills us both!",	"jedi_bark_4":"What are you waiting for?  Go!  Now!  The terminal will get you off the station!",	"jedi_bark_5":"Hurry!  Get off the station!  Use the terminal to escape!"
