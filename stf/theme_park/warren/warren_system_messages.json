Under the command of the magnanimous and brilliant Colonel Bors Teraud, this facility engages in cybernetic and cyborg research for the greater glory of the Empire.  Making use of cutting-edge technology, the brilliant scientists under Colonel Teraud's command are pushing forward the boundaries of cyborg technology and neural interaction!",	"comm_terminal":"SUBJECT:  IMPERIAL INSPECTION CLASSIFIED  TO: COLONEL BORS TERAUD FROM : GRAND MOFF ARDUS KAINE  Colonel, our impatience with your failure to account for the millions of credits in Imperial funding that have gone your way is increasingly leading us to the conclusion that some sort of malfeasance has been attempted. Our previous inspection by an Imperial Inquisitor resulted in the inquisitor never returning, and your bland answers to our inquiries have proven unsatisfactory.  Expect a fresh inspection team, led by Imperial Inquisitor Janna bel Arde. She has the authority to inspect any aspect of your budget and finances, your team, your facility, and your experiments. Should she locate any irregularities whatsoever, you will be relieved of your command. Given the mysterious disappearance of our last auditor, Inquisitor bel Arde will be accompanied by a military contingent.  I need not remind you that your extremely high levels of funding were in large part because of the personal interest that our illustrious Emperor took in your stated project goals. His eye on you can be valuable when you are doing well. I do not think you want his attention under any other circumstances.  TRANSMISSION ENDS ",	"diary_terminal":"Dear diary,  Oh I am so sad today.  Just like yesterday and the day before.  I bet I will be even sadder tomorrow.  Working for Teraud is horrible.  First my friend Matlo vanished, and now my coworker whose name I can't even pronounce, let alone spell, has mysteriously disappeared.  And I have to do all his work!  The screaming from some of the rooms raises the hair on the back of my neck.  They tell us those rooms are off-limits - they don't even trust us to go down one floor without approval from four supervisors.  Like any of us ever want to go down there anyway!  All the animals are creepy, and Teraud's personal Loyalists are even worse!  Considering this is an Imperial Research facility, these people don't seem very loyal to the Empire.  Oh great, more screaming from the ... well that sounds closer than usual.

There is carnage everywhere here and I don't think we're going to last much longer.  I want you to know that I love you very much - as much today as the day of our marriage.  I hope that you have found a safe place to hide until help arrives.  I'm writing this farewell letter in hopes that someone will find it and deliver it to you, because I don't think I'm going to make it out of here alive.  Don't grieve for me.  I have known more happiness in the past few years than anyone deserves, and I'll always be with you in your heart.
