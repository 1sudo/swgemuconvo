They are regarded by many as a gang of thugs, and their reputation is one of violence and destruction. They have attacked and injured countless innocent people and have burned or destroyed endless amounts of property... both public and private.  But some of their actions do not quite fit with the expected behavior of other criminals. During my investigation thus far, one such trend has come to light: the Meatlumps rarely take another being's life. Though their victims number in the thousands, it is very rare that they ever go so far as to kill someone. In fact, my investigation has yet to uncover any evidence of a single death directly caused by the actions of a Meatlump.  Rather, Meatlumps seem to view us as an obstacle that, once out of the way, can be forgotten. Their apparent target in almost every case I've investigated has been a device of some sort. Or something electronic. A communication system. A droid. A power station. A technical console.   Or even a vehicle. Yes, readers, my own speeder was attacked by a group of Meatlumps. They overturned it, and I was thrown clear. From that point on, they ignored me and concentrated on my speeder. Shortly thereafter, two CorSec troopers happened by and the Meatlumps scattered. My speeder was wrecked. Other than the injuries I sustained when my speeder overturned, I was untouched.  The goal desired by the Meatlumps seems to always be destruction of the devices or electronics that they attack. Not theft. They do not appear to benefit in any readily apparent manner. They destroy their target and then leave. That's it.  Do not mistake me, readers, the Meatlumps are dangerous. They are a menace. It is my desire to find out what makes them tick. To learn why they do what they do. But it is not my intention to absolve them of their actions. They must answer for their crimes, but I leave that to the proper authorities. As a reporter, my job is to inform. Right now, I have more questions than I have answers. What drives their attacks? Why do they destroy the things they target?  And who leads them? Until recently, I had heard only rumors of three brothers who lead the Meatlumps. With the help of",	"act1_story_text_end":", I was able to learn more about those who lead the Meatlumps. Their names are Hraykken, Draykken, and Louis Bender. They are indeed brothers. Together they founded the Meatlumps and shaped their gang into what it is today.  As yet, I know little more about these brothers who lead the Meatlumps. Their names are clues to their identities, but tell us very little about what goaded them into forming the Meatlumps. I intend to find out more. In addition, there is evidence that hints of the existence of someone else in the background of all this. Someone to whom even the Bender Brothers seem to defer. Is there a King of the Meatlumps? Or is this person something else entirely?

The Story of the Meatlumps, Part 1  By Vani Korr With Special Thanks to ",	"mtp_king_story_text_middle":"  He exists! Yes, Virginia Landrunner, there is a Meatlump King. And he's nestled smugly in his hideaway underneath Coronet.  After an exhaustive, and exhausting, search, the hideout of the Meatlumps was discovered. They have made themselves a home in some abandoned maintenance tunnels beneath Coronet. It is there that they are hidden away from the eyes of the galaxy and from the grip of modern technology that they so despise. It is there that they feel safe.  Their culture is at once simple and yet surprisingly complex. Meatlumps love common foods, such as their namesake, and are remarkably candid with their needs and desires. And yet they love blowing things up. Their pursuit of the destruction of technology seems endless and yet not without contradiction. For example, I have learned that there are Meatlump camps being established on other planets apart from Corellia. I cannot help but wonder how many Meatlumps fail to restrain their destructive impulses and sabotage their transport in midflight.   Even more enigmatic than the Meatlumps themselves is their King. A strikingly charismatic figure, the Meatlump King holds court far below the streets of Coronet. He is constantly surrounded by his followers, but seems to take no interest in guiding their destructive tendencies. Instead, he allows the Bender Brothers to handle the day to day details of their little gang while the King surrounds himself with cardboard stand-ups and paintings of himself. His court is a non-stop, though reportedly half-hearted, attempt at self glorification.  The Meatlumps are not the brightest stars in the Galaxy. They, and even their King, are easily swayed by the most rudimentary of deceptions and when ",	"mtp_king_story_text_end":" sought to infiltrate their ranks, the Meatlumps all but threw themselves at the chance to open their Hideout to someone they barely knew. It boggles the imagination that the Meatlumps are not only able to avoid prosecution and incarceration, but actually appear to be thriving as they expand and increase their operations throughout many different planets.  But I will give them credit for this: even Meatlumps know that you can't make droids by planting them in the ground.  This is Vani Korr signing off.
