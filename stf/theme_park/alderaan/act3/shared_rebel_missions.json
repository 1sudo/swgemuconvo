Of immediate concern is control of \"Dead Eye\", a once top-secret project headed by Vacca.  Imperial Coordinators in Theed, Kadaara, Narmle, Bestine and Restuss are actively recruiting loyal Imperial subjects to help keep Dead Eye out of Rebellion hands. An increase in recruitment by Rebel Coordinators has been reported in the cities of Coronet, Tyrena, Mos Eisley, Mos Espa and Nashal. No word yet on the nature of the services being sought by the Rebellion. Some insiders believe that the Rebels are working to distribute Dead Eye schematics to their supporters in an effort to increase their effectiveness against the Empire.  As always, the Empire has made it known that anyone found assisting members of the Rebellion are traitors to the Emperor and will be dealt with harshly.  <<END TRANSMISSION>>   [Note: For more information please visit the home page and Events forum at http://www.starwarsgalaxies.com.] "
