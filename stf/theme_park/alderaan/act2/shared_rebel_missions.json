We have received intelligence that indicates the Rebellion has been searching for Dr. Vacca due to his involvement with DEAD EYE. We assure you that Vacca remains safe from harm.  To take an active role in assisting the Empire with this most important case, please seek out an Imperial Coordinator for further instructions. Coordinators have been dispatched to Naboo, Tatooine, and Rori for easy access.  It has been reported that Rebel Coordinators on Corellia, Tatooine and Talus also seek Lyda.
