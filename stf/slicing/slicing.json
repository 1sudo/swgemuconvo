In order for the modifications to work, you'll need to modify the armor's balance and stabilizing systems to accept your changes.  The core systems seem to be protected by a simple Imperial-spec anti-tampering device.  Working carefully, you begin to disable the device.",	"armor_1":"You've managed to disable part of the anti-tampering device.  The designer of this armor did a good job, but you're better.  Removing the second flow regulator cable should give you access to the stabilization systems.",	"armor_analyze_0":"You carefully integrate the analyzer node into the anti-tampering system.  After a few seconds, a scratchy electronic voice in the node says 'Analysis Complete: High probability of positive power flow to anti-tampering device.'",	"armor_analyze_1":"You carefully integrate the analyzer node into the anti-tampering system.

The damage is extensive and while the weapon still retains its previous effectiveness, no one will be able to modify it in the future.",	"hq_security_0":"You remove the terminal's rear access panel.  A jumbled mess of conduits and cables press toward you.  After rooting around for a bit, you find the flow regulator attached to the override security module.",	"hq_security_1":"The security subsystem is partially rerouted.  A little bit more work and you should be able to relax the override terminal's security protocol.",	"hq_security_analyze_0":"You carefully integrate the analyzer node into the security subsystem.

The security protocol for the override terminal has been significantly relaxed.",	"keypad_0":"The panel hinges down to reveal several transistors and a pair of wires snaking through the machinery to the magnetic door lock.",	"keypad_1":"You cut one of the wires.  You seem to have selected the correct one as the locking mechanism didn't auto-disable itself.",	"keypad_analyze_0":"You carefully integrate the analyzer node into the security system.
