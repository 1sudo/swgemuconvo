		"armor_issued":"Armor Appearance altered to your selection.",	"armorsmith_quest":"Welcome back, my student!  There is nothing more I'm willing to teach you about R.I.S. armor crafting.  Practice, practice.  You'll get it right one of these days.",	"conversion_done":"Of course those old armor schematics won't work anymore.  Here! I have updated all those old schematics for you.  Now go away and leave me be!",	"greeting":"Bah!  You waste my time.  The armor crafting techniques I have to offer are far beyond your comprehension.  Come back when you have mastered the armorsmith profession and maybe then you'll have some chance to understand what I have to teach.",	"illegal_response":"Bah! Trying to pull a fast one over me?  I'm far too intelligent to fall for such a dimwitted scheme.",	"inventory_full":"Your inventory is too full to perform this option, please free up 1 inventory slot.",	"no":"No.",	"no_to_quest_1_start":"Sorry, I'm not interested in your lessons.",	"no_to_quest_2_query":"I haven't yet been able to craft it.",	"no_to_quest_3_start":"No. I'd rather practice what I've already learned.",	"no_to_quest_4_query":"I haven't crafted it yet.",	"no_to_quest_5_start":"No. I'm not ready for the next lesson.",	"no_to_quest_6_query":"I haven't managed to craft it yet.",	"not_enough_money":"Bah! You don't even have enough money.  What kind of armorsmith are you?  Go get some work and come back when you can pay my fee.",	"quest_1_description":"As you know, creating armor starts with the armor segment.  That is where we shall start as well.  Like all armor segments, R.I.S. segment require resources which I'm sure you already know how to acquire.  They also, however, require some special components.  For strength, they require bone fragments from a Woolamander Harrower.  For flexibility, they require the hide of a Recluse Gurk King.  To provide inner protection and warmth, they require scales from a Giant Dune Kimogila.  Use this schematic to create the armor segment and bring it back to me.  I don't care how you get the materials, but you must construct the segment yourself.  You can only learn by doing it yourself!  Now go busy yourself with making the armor segment and come back to me when you are done.",	"quest_1_start":"You believe you have learned all there is to know about being armorsmith.  You haven't!  I know far more than you ever will, but still there are a few lessons I could teach you.  Learning these things will not be easy for someone such as you.  It will be expensive in both time and in credits.  Furthermore, I have no patience for insolent students.  You do as I say and don't bother me with stupid questions!  So what do you say?  Give me %DI credits and we'll get started.  Be quick about it!  I'm very busy.",	"quest_1_start_no":"Bah!  Then be off with the likes of you!  I have no time for armorsmith lackies!",	"quest_1_start_yes":"I suspected you would agree to my terms.  Let's get started.  I'm going to teach you how to construct my masterpiece invention: R.I.S armor.  This armor has no equal in battle.   Everything else is junk compared to this!  Of course, it is exceedingly difficult to create, especially for a fledgling armorsmith such as you.  But, no matter.  We'll take it slow so you can comprehend.  Are you with me so far?",	"quest_2_complete":"Let's see how you did... Bah!  Look at these mounting tabs! They aren't even on straight!  This flexor matrix has the plasticity of carbonite!  I was hoping for a better showing, my student, but I guess this will have to do.  Keep practicing.  If you can't handle the fundamentals, everything else will suffer!  But no! I'm sure you don't want to practice.  Just rush onto the next lesson, I bet.  I suppose that's what you want to do?",	"quest_2_incomplete":"Bah!  Then why are you here?  Don't expect me to do everything it for you.  If you want to learn, but have to be willing to put in the effort!  Now get to work!",	"quest_2_query":"The student returns!  Show me what you have learned in crafting the %TO.",	"quest_3_start":"Next I will to teach you how to craft the R.I.S armor layer.  A remarkable component this is.  This layer provides no additional protection but it key to learning how to craft the more useful feathered armor layer.  No complaints!  Do what you are told and make me the layer, here is the schematic.  You'll need some feathers from the rare Peko Peko Albatross... a bit nasty of a critter.  Hop to it!",	"quest_3_start_no":"Fine, fine.  Practice up.  Come back when you are ready for the next lesson.",	"quest_4_complete":"Let's see how you did this time... Bah! The lattice orientation of the absorption medium should be 65.3 degrees off of the axis of principal stress of the reinforcement matrix.  65.3 degrees!  How do you expect this to handle blaster fire any other way?  Still, it isn't terrible for a first attempt.  Of course, I'd be embarrassed to put my name on that thing, but that's why I'm the teacher and you're the student.  Are you ready for the next lesson?",	"quest_4_incomplete":"Well then, go on and get that finished up.  I'm not going anywhere.",	"quest_4_query":"You return again.  Okay, let's see it.  Where's the %TO you crafted?",	"quest_5_start":"You've finally managed to learned the basics.  Now I will teach you how to craft the armor, itself.  We'll start with the boots.  If you can't get the boots right,  I don't care how good the rest of the armor is.  If your feet hurt, it just doesn't matter!  Here's the schematic for the boots.  The schematic is very self explanatory.   What!  You aren't already done yet?",	"quest_5_start_no":"No ready, huh?  Very well, I'll be here when you are.",	"quest_6_complete":"A little small, don't you think?  Who were you making these for? A Jawa?  Nevertheless, these do look marginally acceptable.  I think you are getting the hang of this.  Tell you what.  I think you've learned enough to do this on your own.  Here are the rest of the schematics.  Don't make me look bad and don't forget to practice, practice.  And be sure to come back and visit sometimes.  It's not every day that I have a student actually complete my lessons.  Since you also did it in a timely manner I will also grant you the feathered enhancement schematic.  Use it to improve the appearance of any type of armor.  Now, I'll be getting back to my work...",	"quest_6_incomplete":"Don't let me down now!  Get crafting!",	"quest_6_query":"Back again!  Most of my students have quit by this point.  Let's see the %TO you crafted.",	"schematic_issued":"Mandalorian armor schematic issued! Please see an appropriate crafter to craft you a new piece of Mandalorian armor from this schematic.",	"segment_issued":"RIS armor segment issued! Please see an Armor smith to craft you a new piece of RIS armor from this segment.",	"yes":"Yes.",	"yes_to_quest_1_start":"I am ready to begin.  Here are the credits.",	"yes_to_quest_2_query":"I have it right here.",	"yes_to_quest_3_start":"Yes, am I ready to continue.",	"yes_to_quest_4_query":"Here it is.",	"yes_to_quest_5_start":"Yes. I am ready to learn more.",	"yes_to_quest_6_query":"Here it is.",	"bounty_hunter_converted":"Your Bounty Hunter Armor can now be used in the construction of Mandalorian Armor",	"must_refit":"You must use the Refit option on the radial menu before using this option.",	"wookiee_resized":"Your Wookiee armor has been converted so you may now wear Cybernetics with it."
