Travel to this waypoint and you will be attacked by enemy fighters. Each time you destroy a wave of fighters a new wave will attack. Once you have destroyed all the attack waves at one waypoint, you will receive a new waypoint that you can fly to and continue destroying the enemy craft. A destroy duty will continue in this manner until you decide to stop."
