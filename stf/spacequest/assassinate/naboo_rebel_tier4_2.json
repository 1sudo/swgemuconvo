He's a master tactician and has an uncanny ability to find what he's looking for. One of our spy ships got lucky though and found his travel route through the Yavin system. Unfortunately most of our space fleet is used in escort missions but it is my hope that you will be able to terminate Uvqolo while he's still en route to the Inquisitions space station."
