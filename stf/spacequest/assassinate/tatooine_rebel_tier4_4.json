You are now one of the best the Alliance Navy has to offer, make sure you keep it that way. The attack in the Endor system didn't give us any useful information to the production of the new Imperial fighters and now it's too late anyway, they are spread through out the galaxy. For this mission, Intel has provided us with information that a TIE Bomber is carrying some important machinery to the surface of the moon of Endor. Let's make sure it never reaches its destination."
