An escort duty is a voluntary mission that you are able to quit at any time without repercussions. When you reach the Corellia system, you will get a navigation waypoint to the arrival location of an Imperial freighter that you will need to escort through the system. Travel to the waypoint and wait until the freighter hyperjumps into the system. Once it is in the area, it will begin to fly through the system. You need to follow the freighter until it reaches its destination. Keep a careful eye out for enemy attack since they will attempt to destroy this freighter. Once completed you will receive another waypoint to the arrival location of another freighter. This escort duty can be stopped at any time by simply aborting the mission or leaving the system."
