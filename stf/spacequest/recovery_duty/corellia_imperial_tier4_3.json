Once in the system you will receive a navigation waypoint to the smugglers most recent location. This navigation waypoint will update as the smuggler moves through the system. You must intercept the smuggler before he is able to leave the system. Once you have reached the smuggler, disable it by targeting the vessels engines. After you have the vessel disabled, move in close and wait for the capture process to begin. Now that the vessel is captured, escort it through the system and back into Imperial hands. After this is completed you will receive a new navigation waypoint to another Velocity smuggler that needs to be captured. This is a duty mission and can be quit at any time. Simply abort the mission or leave the system in order to stop the mission."
