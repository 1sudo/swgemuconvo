She doesn't expect any trouble from the nearby pirates, other than an occassional Valarian or two. A'Lerris mentioned that there has been heightened activity around the field and more pirates have been attacking as of late. I'm beginning to wonder why. Basically, A'Lerris and her employees don't trust me. Why should they? They're practically surrounded by Hutts daily and come in contact with them and their wicked schemes, diminishing any sliver of trust they may have reserved for anyone else. I hope to earn their respect. Maybe they'll have more meaningful tasks for me. It's not to say escorting freighters isn't meaningful. I'm just looking for something... more."
