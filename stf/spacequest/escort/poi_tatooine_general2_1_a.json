I can't keep losing freighters because of you!",	"found_loc":"I've transmitted the location at which you'll meet the freighter. Guide it to safety. Again, we expect no problems during this run.

I hope to gain the trust of the miners here in the Tatoo System. The chance has been brought to me in the way of small tasks given to me by A'Lerris Verata, the strong leader of the mining efforts in this system. My second task is much like my first; I must escort a freighter from the mining field to home base so rich resources can be fed into their outpost. And, much like the last time, I will do well."
