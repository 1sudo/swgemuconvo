The Rebels will know this is a trap.",	"arrived_at_loc":"Wait for the decoy shuttle to arrive and then begin the mission. To completely sell this deception, you are going to have kill several attacking waves of enemy fighters before we can be sure the Rebels will think the information is genuine.",	"assigned_delayed":"",	"attack_notify":"pcontrast1 Tactical Computer:pcontrast3 <Enemy fighters detected. Incoming at high speeds.>",	"attack_stopped":"pcontrast1 Tactical Computer:pcontrast3 <Enemy fighter destroyed. Detecting no further ships.>",	"autorewardbody":"",	"autorewardfrom":"",	"autorewardsubject":"",	"complete":"You may have succeeded in getting the Rebels the plans but there is very little chance that they are going to believe that they are real. We cannot write this one off as a complete failure but you didn't accomplish what was needed of you. Report back into your commander.",	"escort_too_far1":"Pilot, if you leave the decoy shuttle unprotected the Rebels will know something is wrong. Stay with the shuttle and destroy those Rebels so they think what is on that shuttle is important.",	"escort_too_far2":"Pilot, the Rebels are getting suspicious. Get back here and put on a good show.",	"escort_too_far3":"Blast it! The Rebels are leaving, this is obviously a trap. Way to blow the operation. Report back to your superior.",	"failed_destroy":"Pilot, that was too easy. The Rebels might scan the wreckage and find the plans but they are never going to believe them. They are rebellious, not stupid. You are going to need to report back to your commander.",	"failed_protect":"Pilot, that was too easy. The Rebels might scan the wreckage and find the plans but they are never going to believe them.  They are rebellious, not stupid. You are going to need to report back to your commander.",	"found_loc":"Meet up with the decoy shuttle at supplied navigation location. Once the enemy attacks, destroy several of their attack waves. When we have their curiosity peeked, the shuttle will make a run for it and allow itself to be captured. Just make sure you put on a good show and destroy at least four attack waves.",	"goodbye_1":"Blast it! You didn't destroy nearly enough of those fighters for the Rebels to be interested in following me. This mission is a big failure. Report back into your superior.",	"goodbye_2":"Blast it! You didn't destroy nearly enough of those fighters for the Rebels to be interested in following me. This mission is a big failure. Report back into your superior.",	"goodbye_3":"Blast it!

Report back into your superior.",	"hull_half":"Hull is at half strength! I have to stay alive for longer or the Rebels will not buy the fake plans. Get them off of me and destroy some more waves!",	"panic_1":"Excellent! It looks like the Rebels are coming to investigate.

We have the fake plans on our ship. Remember, you need to make this look real! Once the enemy attacks, destroy several of their attacking waves to make them think you are protecting some valuable information. Once we have done enough to sell our project, I will pretend to make a run for it and let the shuttle be captured.",	"reason_2":"Alright! We have the fake plans on our ship.

We can't let them capture me too early. The Rebels may be weak but they are not dumb. If they take me too easily, they will never buy it.",	"split_quest_alert":"That should be enough to get the Rebels convinced that those fake documents are the real deal. The decoy shuttle is making a run for it and will let himself get captured. Keep a close watch, because it looks like the Rebels have also developed an unhealthy interest in you. Destroy any vessels that attack you and stand by for further notice.",	"split_quest_alert_fail":"",	"taunt_1":"You might as well run since you cannot win.",	"taunt_2":"Just hand over the transport and no one gets hurt.",	"taunt_3":"If I were you I would run, Imperial dog.",	"taunt_4":"You are going to regret trying to fight.",	"taunt_5":"You might as well run since you cannot win.",	"thanks_1":"That's it!
