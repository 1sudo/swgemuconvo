Once you enter the system, wait until Imperial command sends you a navigation waypoint to the freighter's most recent location.

Move in close to the Torton Runner and wait for the capture process to begin. It might take a couple minutes for the process to begin so you will need to stay close to the vessel while this is happening. Wait until the capture process is completed before you move away from the Torton Runner. You will be vulnerable at this point so it might be a good idea to destroy any escort vessels that are with the ship before attempting to capture it.",	"quest_recover_t":"Capture the Torton Runner",	"quest_update":" pcontrast3 Black Epsilon Command: < pcontrast1 %TO pcontrast3 >",	"recovery_success":"The freighter is secured, operation successful.",	"split_quest_alert":"",	"split_quest_alert_fail":"",	"target_disabled":"The freighter has been disabled, move close in order to upload the virus.

Once you arrive in the Corellia system, wait until Imperial command can get you the location of the target freighter. Once they have a lock, you will receive a navigation waypoint to its current location. This navigation waypoint will update as the Tortun Runner moves through the system. Follow these navigation waypoints until you intercept the freighter. Once you have intercepted the freighter, disable it by targeting the vessel's subsystems. Use the '[' or ']' to target the Torton Runner's engines and then attack the ship until its engines are at 0%. Now move in close to the freighter and wait for the capture process to begin. This process may take a couple of minutes so you will need to stay near the freighter until it begins. Be careful because you will be vulnerable while waiting for the capture process to complete. Once the vessel is captured you will need to escort it to safety. Follow the Torton Runner until it reaches its destination. Keep an eye out for enemy fighters who might attempt to retake the vessel."
