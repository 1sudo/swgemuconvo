		"title_d":"Travel to the Corellia system and capture the Torton Runner. Once you arrive in the Corellia system, wait until Imperial command can get you the location of the target freighter. Once they have a lock, you will receive a navigation waypoint to its current location. This navigation waypoint will update as the Tortun Runner moves through the system. Follow these navigation waypoints until you intercept the freighter. Once you have intercepted the freighter, disable it by targeting the vessel's subsystems. Use the '[' or ']' to target the Torton Runner's engines and then attack the ship until its engines are at 0%. Now move in close to the freighter and wait for the capture process to begin. This process may take a couple of minutes so you will need to stay near the freighter until it begins. Be careful because you will be vunlerable while waiting for the capture process to complete. Once the vessel is captured you will need to escort it to safety. Follow the Torton Runner until it reaches its destination. Keep an eye out for enemy fighters who might attempt to retake the vessel.",		"title":"Corellia System: Capture the Torton Runner",		"thanks_5":"Imperial dog!
