Once you enter the system, wait until Imperial command sends you a navigation waypoint to the transport's most recent location.

Move in close to the hostage transport and wait for the capture process to begin. It might take a couple minutes for the process to begin so you will need to stay close to the vessel while this is happening. Wait until the capture process is completed before you move away from the hostage transport. You will be vulnerable at this point so it might be a good idea to destroy any escort vessels that are with the ship before attempting to capture it.",	"quest_recover_t":"Capture the Hostage Transport",	"quest_update":" pcontrast3 Storm Squadron Command: < pcontrast1 %TO pcontrast3 >",	"recovery_success":"The hostages are safe and are en route to base.

Once you arrive in the Lok system, wait until Imperial command can get you the location of the target transport. Once they have a lock, you will receive a navigation waypoint to its current location. This navigation waypoint will update as the hostage transport moves through the system. Follow these navigation waypoints until you intercept the transport. Once you have intercepted the transport, disable it by targeting the vessel's subsystems. Use the '[' or ']' to target the hostage transport's engines and then attack the ship until its engines are at 0%. Now move in close to the transport and wait for the capture process to begin. This process may take a couple of minutes so you will need to stay near the transport until it begins. Be careful because you will be vulnerable while waiting for the capture process to complete. Once the vessel is captured you will need to escort it to safety. Follow the hostage transport until it reaches its destination. Keep an eye out for enemy fighters who might attempt to retake the vessel."
