Despite the company telling the cult that they have nothing to do with the salvage operation underway in the Yavin system, the cult has continued its harrasment of company operations. Recently the cult has captured one of the mining company executives and is threatening to kill him unless their demands are met. The Yavin mining company wants you to find and rescue their executive. The debris cult has not covered their steps very well and the mining company has located the source of the cults demands. They think that inspecting that vessel will be a good start to finding their missing executive."
