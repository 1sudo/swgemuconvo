		"title_d":"While eliminating the Zynt'aia influence in the mining field located close to A'Lerris' outpost, I received a distressful call from Miss Verata herself. It seems that one of her freighters has been captured by the Zynt'aia Order. It is my duty to travel to its known location and rescue it from the hands of her--now "our"--enemies.

I must prepare myself.",		"quest_dock_t":"Dock with the Darksing D-45",		"quest_dock_d":"I must find the disabled Darksing D-45 and dock with it once I've found it.

Travel there and rescue it before it's too late. Please, pilot. We needn't lose any more lives to this frivolous mess. I expect you to do well.",		"arrival_phase_1":"Listen closely, pilot. Soon, I will transmit the data needed to find our downed freighter. It is your job to rescue it and fly it home to safety.",		"abort":"Why are you doing this to us? We're so close to going home!"
