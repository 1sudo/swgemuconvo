The intelligence that we have suggests that the Inquisition is looking for a Jedi on these ships. The civilian vessels are drifting in space while the Inquisitions capital ships are closing in and your orders are to beat them to the punch. Your ship is equipped with repair material that can be transferred to the transports. When you feel that you have exhausted your ship, yourself or that you have enough experience to continue your training, you can return to base at anytime."
