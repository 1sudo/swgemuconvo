Since the Empire is unsure where the X-wing fighter cadets are located in the Naboo system, you will receive a few navigation waypoints to suspected areas of Rebel activity. You can check out area around the waypoints to see if you can locate the Rebel cadets or just search the system yourself.  When you complete this mission, return to Lt. Barn Sinkko in Kaadara for your next assignment."
