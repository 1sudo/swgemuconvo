Due to my presence, and my assistance with the mining efforts, the Zynt'aia Pirates have begun to spring unwanted and stealthy attacks against the peaceful miners. It is my duty, as a directive from A'Lerris herself, to clear the Zynt'aia influence from the mining field. Unfortunately, it seems the Zynt'aia Order has stirred and moved in to claim the field, destroying freighters and miners alike with little to no thought at all. It is time to extinguish the influence and replenish the balance."
