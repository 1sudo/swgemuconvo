You have been ordered to weaken the Imperial forces who have already taken up positions inside the system. The black holes in the system make it impossible to get a lock on individual ships so it will be necessary to seek and destroy all targets involved. You are required to hunt down fighters and smaller, non-capital command vessels. The vessels that you are required to destroy are TIE variants and the Imperial Gunboats."
